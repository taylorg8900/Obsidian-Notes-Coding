What is a Sprint?
- According to Erik Falor, my cs1440 teacher at USU, in the Software Engineering industry, a 'sprint' is a 2-week period of time where plans and schedules are created. This is to help people stay focused, as having a very large project without a concrete and tangible time frame leads to a loss of focus.

What is a mini sprint?
- Something I am creating
- I feel like 2 weeks might be too long, so I want a schedule that focuses on each 1 week instead

### 2025.02.09 to 2025.02.15

This might be a little out of left field but I want to try taking another stab at figuring out graph theory problems since psuedocode is the fucking GOAT. After finishing cs1440 project 2 where I had to write a lot of it, and actually semi-complicated programs ran on the first try since I wrote everything out in pseudocode, I feel like I could try to understand something really complicated again.

Things to do in tavern-project-GODOT before getting to graph theory:
- [x] get git working from command line
- [ ] reorganize project
- [ ] get rid of unecessary files
- [ ] create txt docs for a software development plan sort of thing
