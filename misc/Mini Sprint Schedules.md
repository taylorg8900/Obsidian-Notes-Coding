What is a Sprint?
- According to Erik Falor, my cs1440 teacher at USU, in the Software Engineering industry, a 'sprint' is a 2-week period of time where plans and schedules are created. This is to help people stay focused, as having a very large project without a concrete and tangible time frame leads to a loss of focus.
