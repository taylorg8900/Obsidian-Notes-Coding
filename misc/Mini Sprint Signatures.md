| 2025.02.03 | cs1410 assn4 | 80 min     | created linear search, binary search, bubble sort, and almost selection sort from scratch. not done with assignment yet                                                |
| 2025.02.04 | cs1410 assn5 | 73 min     | finished the very confusingly written second half of the assignment, java.utils.Array.sort seems to use merge sort or something good to know about                     |
|            | cs1440 proj2 | 115 min    | got phase 0 done, which is reading all of the requirements and basically understanding how the assignment is structured. The next thing is to start writing pseudocode |
| 2025.02.07 | cs1440 proj2 | 44 min     | completed `cat`                                                                                                                                                        |
