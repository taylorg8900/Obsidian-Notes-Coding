Summary for today: Designing algorithms is going to be the focus of this class, with an emphasis on the principles and techniques that go into creating them more so than just learning what various ones are. Because of this AI is discouraged. Basically this class is supposed to teach you how to think 'algorithmically'. Algorithms are things that take some input and produce some output, and you want algorithms to be particularly efficient in terms of how long they take, or how much space / memory they use.

syllaubs
	stuff like email, office, number, class hours, TA stuff
	course topics
		algorithm analysis
		divide and conquier
		dynamic programming
		graph algorithms
		computational complexity
	books
		dont need them for class
		they are in library aparently
		way too far away for me to read what they are
	citations/work
		for assignments people in the class don't look up answers for algorithsm
		this makes me think that the algorithms are doable for me too
		'needs lot of work' he says, 'takes some time to figure out the solution'
		sometimes group work in class where students get together to work through an exercise, dunno how that is gonna go lol
		'lots of interesting activities' in class
	AI
		dont use it basically, its cheating

slides
	course overview
		algorithm analysis techniques
			growth of functions
				time/space cmplexity and BIG O notation
			solving recurrences (?)
			amortized analysis (?)
		algorithm design techniques
			learn techniques to solve algorithms rather than just the algorithms, to solve new problems
			algorithms taught in class are only used as examples
		Divide and conquer
			merge srot, maxumum subarray, maximal points
			analysis tech (type too slow, didnt finish)
			apparently prof teaches this every day
		graph algorithms
			BFS, DFS, topological sort, Dijkstra's algorithm, minum spanning trees 
		computational complexity,: P, NP, NP-hard, NP-complete
			definitions
			how to prove a problem is NP-complete, 'problem reduction'
		'algorithmic thinking'
			how can you see a problem nd solve it in different ways
			biology, social science, network analysis, etc multiple different ways this can show up
		who cares?
			algorithms are the bedrock of CS, like quicksort and mergesort used in database operations
			search engines, google's pagerank algorithm
			data analysis and visualization
				complex data structures and algorithms enable us to handle bigdata
			AI and machine learning
				AI is built on fancy algorithms
					gradient descent in neural networks, decision trees in clasifcation problems
			Natural language processing
				tekenization and LSTM networks in language models
			social media nad recommender systems
				algorithms determine what you see online
			"mastering algorithms equips you with the skill lto excel in any field within computer science."
	what is an algorithm
		a step by step procedure for calculation
		a well defined computerational procedure that takes some values as input and produces some values as output. basically transforms the intput into the output
		input -> algorithm -> output
	what is a good algorithm
		correct
			unsorted array -> sorted array
		use less resources
			time, memory/space
			importatnt to make it less resource intensive
	Warm up question
		if you have an array of 1...n of size A how do you find the largest value in it (it is unsorted)
			solution 1: just compare each number to each other as you iterate and store the largest value of the two 
				this has N-1 comparisons, where N is the amount of elements in the array, time complexity is O(n-1)
			solution 2: compare every other set of 2 numbers with each other, and repeat until you are down to the last 2 (so 16-8-4-2-1) 
				i think has complexity of nlog(2)?
				number of comparison is 2^N -1 ? is that actually right
					this is wrong because i have the wrong variable name, was something else 
	sorting
		best sorting algorithm without any further assumption is O(nlogn), has been proven mathematically apparently 
	warm up question two
		if you have an array of 1...n of size A how do you get both the min and max values in it (unsorted)
			solution 1: for the first comparison, the min is the smallest one and the max is the largest one, then do the same thing as solution 1 for previous warm up question 
				double the comparison here, so 2N-1
			solutions 2: use #term BINARY COMPARISON
				for i = 1 to n (i = i + 2)
					if A[i] > A[i+1]
						if A[i]>max
							max=A[i]
						if A[i] < min
							min = A[i]
					else
						if A[i+1] > max
							max = A[i+1]
						if A[1] < min
							min = A[i]
				have a step size of two
				compare the numbers which are next to each other
				still is O(n)
				also can not be better than O(n), proven apparently
	warm up question 3
		input: array of A[1....n] of distince numbers
		output: max and secondMax
		objective: design an algorithm such that the numbreof comparisons is as small as possible
		solution:  use the solution from warm up 1 and just keep both numbers, which is what i was thinking
			issue is that the secondMax would not survive if it is in the same brackets as the Max
			solution to this issue: keep track of all comparisons that the max had, size of this structure is logN (if 8 leaf nodes, 3 branches to keep track of) so complexity is O(n + logn)
				find the max using binary comparison, and then backtrack our binary tree
