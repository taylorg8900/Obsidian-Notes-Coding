sumarry for today: More comparing algorithms against each other to figure out which has a smaller/larger time complexity. More syntax of saying f(n) belongs to the set of big o/small o/theta of g(n) and stuff like that. That kind of comparison is saying f(n) belongs to the family of g(n). Next lesson will be about divide and conquer.

practice problems
	1) asking if a function belongs to the set of big O, small O, theta of another function
	2) sort the following time complexities ascendingly
selectino sort vs insertion sort
	find the best and worst case scenario for both
	selection sort: best case n^2 worst case n^2
	insertion sort: best case n worst case n^2
today: algorithm analysis
next time: divide and conquer
