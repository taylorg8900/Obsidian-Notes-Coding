summary for today: comparing two different functions to find out which is better, and using limits from calc to do it. The order of betterness is constant < logarithmic < polynomial < exponential. A ton of examples today, lowkey was falling asleep

big O functions
	o1 constant time
	o(log n) logarithmic time
	o(n) linear time
	o(n^2) quadratic time
	o(n^3) cubic time
	o(n^x) polynomial time
	o(2^n) exponential time
upper bounds
	we are interested in asympotic stuff because when n is large, we want to know which functions act as upper bounds for other ones to understand which ones are always going to be smaller than others when N is very large
big omega
	more math stuff that i dont know if i should care to write down cuz idk what to do with it
	the opposite of big O though, where it provides a lower bound instead of upper bound
small o 
	strict upper bound
	for all constants C f(n) is smaller than g(n), not just after some point aka asymptotically smaller 
calc stuff
	lim n-> infinity (f(n)/g(n)) = {
		c ... f(n) = theta(g(n))
		small o ... f(n) = smalll o(g(n))
		positive infinity ... f(n) = small omega(g(n))
		}
	this is how you compare two functions, find out if another is big O, small O, small omega
	#important brush up on limits in calculus if you want to actually be good at finding out if one function if better than another
rule 1 
	constant < logarithmic < polynomial < exponential
rule 2
	for any a>0, b>0, c>1
	(logn)^a < n^b < c^n 
	(quadratic - polynomial - exponential basically )
	sidenote: c must be larger than 1 bc exponential and if it isnt then function gets smaller 
big O
	'lowest possible upper bound'
