## divide and conquer
threee major steps
	1) divide: divide problem into a number of (usually two) supbroblems that are smaller instances of the original problem
	2)  solve the subporblems recursively 
		'base case': if the ssubproblem is small enough, solve it in a straighforward way
	3) combine: combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the orignal problem
	"remark: combine step is the most important step and it is the size that does the actual work for solving the problem"
	examples:
		finding the largest number
			input: an array A\[1...n] of n elements
			output: the largest number of A
			divide: divide A\[1...n] into two subarrays of roughly equal size
			conquer: find the largest number from A\[1...n/2] and A\[n/2 + 1....n]
			combine: return the larger of the two numbers
			`max(A,i,j) => function max returns the largest element from A[i...j]
			`# call max(A,1,n)
			`max(A,i,j)`
				`# base case`
				`if i = j
					`return A[i]
				`# divide `
				`mid = [(i + j)/2]
				`max1 = max(A,i,mid)
				`max2 = max(A,mid+1,j)
				`# return the largest of max1 and max2
				`max(A,1,n)`
				`if max1> max2
					`return max1
				`else
					`return max2
		merge sort
			input: an arrayA\[1...n] of n elements
			output: sort A in ascending order
			divide: divide A\[1...n] into two subarrays A\[1...n/2] and A\[n/2 + 1] of rougly equal sizes
			conquer: sort A\[1...n/2] and A\[n/2 + 1] recursively
			combine: merge the two sorted lists for the two subarrays into a sorted list for A\[1...n]
			`# key idea: given two sorted arrays, we can merge them into one sorted array in linear time
			`# student's idea: compare first element of both, then second element of both, then third, fourth, etc instead of using insertion sort or quicksort on a combined array




finding time complexity
	not noting everything down just paying attention
	one way of finding it is expanding the recursion, noticing a pattern, and saying step k = whatever, and find where to put k in to turn it into a formula

finish merge sort next lecture
