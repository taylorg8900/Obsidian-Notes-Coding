summary for today: queues. First example of a queue is using an array to store elements and using a head and tail pointer to access it. Second example is using two stacks to create a queue


quiz 1 is on 1/21-1/22
	i guess if no class then i can just keep walking to my car since this is the last class
review
	data structures are either contiguous or linked, use either arrays or pointers
Queue
	the element deleted is always the one that has been there longest
	FIFO policy
	'two doors system': enqueue (insert) in one door, and dequeue (delete) from other
		Head + Tail
		element dequeued is at the 'Head' of the queue
		element enqueued is at the 'Tail' of the queue
	queue rules
		we can implement a queue of at most n-1 elements from an array (duh)
		initialization: Q.head = Q.tail = 1
		empty condition: Q.head = Q.tail
		full condition: Q.head = Q.tail + 1
			this has to do with a circular queue, where if n is the length of the array, then 1 is the next index
	essentially if you have an array of some size, you have a head and a tail pointer to keep track of elements that have been added/deleted from it and the position of both the head and tail will change depending on if there was an enqueue or a dequeue
	circular queue structure must have one thing empty so that you dont break it when it is full, because the empty and full condition would be equal otherwise
	practice problem 1
		'write an algorithm hat iplements two stacks in one array in such a way that neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stracks together is n'.
		bro is constantly switching from first element being 0 index and 1 index which is confusing
implement queue using two stacks
	step A: how to reverse a stack
		'imagine our stack like a bottle, we push {1,2,3}'
		'w ewant to reverse the stack so that the top element of the stack will be 1, and the bottom element of the stack will be 3. we can take the bottle and hold it upsdie down so that all the values should reverse in order'
		'to do the same process, we need to have a second stack that which is going to store the first stack elements in reverse order. let's put our populated stack to the left and our new empty stack to the right. to reverse the order of the elements, we are going to pop each element from left stack, and push them to the right stack'
	step B: using two stacks for making a queue
		'our queue model will consist of two stacks. one stack will be used for enqueue operation, another stack will be used for the dequeue operation'
	enqueue operation: push every input element to the input stack
	dequeue operation
		1) if outpust stack is empty, pop every element in input stack and push them to outpust stack until it is empty again
		2) pop from output stack
all of this is to say that there are different types of queues, and today was about principles for two different types (first was array, second was using two stacks to create a queue)
