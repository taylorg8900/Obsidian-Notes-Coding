summary: covering insertion and deletion of nodes in linked lists, and why they are better for implementing stacks/queues than arrays

today linked list
next hash table
then quiz 1
some kind of group assignment coming up
	this sounds really goddamn annoying tbh im glad im not actually in the class lol

linked list
	a data structure in which the objects are arranged in a linear order
	unlike an array, where linear order is determined by the array indices, the order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each object
	classifications
		single/double linked list
		circular linked list
		unsorted linked list
singly linked list
	structure: two fields
		key field + next field
		key field holds the data, next field is a pointer to the next object
doubly linked list
	structure: 3 fields
		key field holds data
		next field holds address of next data object
		prev field holds the address of previous object
	end of list is characterized by next field having NULL as it's info
	beginning of list is characterized by prev field having NULL as it's info
circular linked list
	last object points to first object, vice versa if doubly linked 
insertion in singly linked list: at head
	create a new object, and make it's memory the address of the current head of the linked list
insertion in singly linked list: at tail
	loop through the linked list until you hit the node with it's next field being NULL
	replace null pointer with the address of the node to be inserted
	set node to be inserted next field to NULL
insertion in singly linked list: in middle
	x.next = y.next
	y.next = x
	essentially dont replace the pointer in y with x or the rest of the list is bye bye
deletion in singly linked list: at head
	list.head = liest.head.next 
	simple 
deletion in singly linked list: at tail
	we need a trailing pointer for this
	P = list.head, Q = NULL (Q is trailing pointer)
	while( P.next != NULL)
		Q = P
		P = P.next
	Q.next = NULL
deletion in singly linked list: in middle
	P = list.head
	while (P.next != y)
		P = P.next
	P.next = y.next

why use linked lists?
	they are more flexible than arrays when it comes to adding or removing items
search with a key
	x = list.head
	while x != NULL and x.key != K
		x = x.next
	return x
 creating stacks/queues
	can just use the ideas above to create either, by using insertion and deletion

example problems that everyone else has access to
	reversing a singly linked list
		use in place manipulation instead of creating a second linked list to store
