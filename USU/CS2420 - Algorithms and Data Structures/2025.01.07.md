summary for today: over the semester we are going to talk about data structures, algorithm design, and lastly graphs. While covering an extensive list of topics (see topic list), the class lectures will be in pseudocode so the principles can be applied in any programming language. In problem solving, there is a distinction between leveraging advanced algorithms versus advanced data structures to solve them, which both have their place. Finding out how to use either approach effectively comes down to practice.


first half/ second half/ third half
open course = syllabus somewhere online

topic list
	data structures stacks, queues, linked list, hash tables, binary search trees, graphs
	asymptotic notation and computational compolexity
	divide and conquer and solving occurrences
	seatching algorithsm
	sorting algorithms
	dynamic programming
	greedy algorithms
	graph algorithms
course objectives
	learn to solve problems using different data structures
	analyze the growth of functions via asymptotic notation
	solve recurrence relations of the kinds encountered in algorithm analysis
	design algorithms using the divide and conquer technique, greedy strategy, and dynamic progrmming
	analyze the design, correctness, and time complexity of different algorithms
	learn the transition of data structures and algorithms of codes of high level programming languages and perform complexity analysis on them
focus of couse is ideas, not in any particular language
	all algorithms in class are pseudocode which is great for me
why do we need this class?
	analyzing algorithms
		what is complexity of whatever code you are looking at?
first half of class is stuff on data structures, and second half is on algorithm design
	example of stuff in first half: hash tables, linked list, binary search tree
	example of stuff in second half: divide and conquer, runtime calculation of recurrences, deriving complexity from recurrence, substitution method, recursion tree method, Master Theorem
		use recurrence to find big O
third half of class
	sorting algorithms, graphs
		types, memory representation, traversal algorithms, shortest path, minumum spanning trees, 
books
	data structures and algorithm analysis in Java person addison wesley
	weiss MA
	introduction to algorithms carmen TH, leserson CE revist RL and Stein C 2009
	data abstration and problem solving with Java addison-wesley
	no book is really followed in this class, but some websites are going to be used over and over apparently
syllabus is public apparently, since it is an open course

fisrt lecture stuff
algorithm
	#term algorith: any computational procedure that takes some valueor set of values as input and produces some vlue or set of values as output
	input -> black box / function / model -> output
	one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many
	'field of exactness', different from data science which uses machine learning
	#term exact algorithm vs approximation algorithm
		approximation algorithm stinky and not discussed in this class
We are living in algorithms
	search queries, online shopping, navigation, searching flights, anything really
example of an algorithm
	sorting problem
	'an algorithm is said to be #term correct if for every input instance it halts with the correct output'
what is data structures?
	a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively
	no single data structure works well everywhere, so it is important to know the pros and cons of them
problem solving
	algorithm perspective vs data structure perspective
	adavanced data structure
		hip sort for sorting a number, uses ___ data structure
	advanced algorithm 
		merge sort uses 'DNC' ____
	getting good at deciding the approach to solving a problem using data structures or algorithms or both comes down to practice and there isnt really a class for it

review of java fundamentals
	info from slides which are on canvas therefore i will never see :(
	comments
		stuff like /* and // and whatever
	data types and stuff
	references 
		data type used to locate an object
		pointers? 
	a ton of stuff which is just stuff from C which is good for me 
	#term switch statements
	#term inheritance
		technique for creating a new lass that is based on one that already exists, it inherits the attributes of the root class
	#term data fields
		public, private, protected, static, final, transient,
Stacks and Queues
	data structues can be calls contiguous or linked, depending on whether they are based on arrays or pointers
	#term contiguously-allocated structues
		compsed of single slabs of memory
		arrays, matrices, heaps, hash tables
	#term linked data structues
		composed of distinct chunks of memory bound togehter by pointers
		linked list, trees, graphs
	#term stack
		the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted
		Last In First Out policy
		Insert operation on a stack is often called PUSH, and the DELETE operation is often called POP
		pseudocode is often indexed a 1 not 0 because doing math is harder otherwise
