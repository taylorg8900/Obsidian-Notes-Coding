what we cant do with arrays
- arrays are fixed size (no appending)

ArrayList
```java
ArrayList<String> cities = new ArrayList<String>();
```

angle brackets are used because of generics, which we haven't talked about yet and will do later 

How to add to the arraylist
```java
cities.add("name");
```

using a print statement with the array list will print out a nice looking thing instead of a memory address
```commandLine
System.out.println(cities); -> [A, B, C, D, etc]
```

how to access elements in the array list - has 0 indexing
```java
System.out.printf("city: %s", cities.get(1));

for (String city : cities){
	System.out.println(city);
}
```

methods available to the ArrayList object:
- add(E element)
- set(int index, E element)
- get(int index)
- remove(int index)
- remove(Object o) like `list.remove("Orange");`
- size()
- contains(Object o)
- clear() (removes all elements from the list)
- indexOf(Object o)
- isEmpty()
- toArray() (turns it into an array)
- subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex) (returns a smaller list from the arraylist)

# Visibility
types 
- public, private, default, protected

public
- no restrictions on where or when you can modify an attribute of a class
- can be applied to: classes, methods, attributes

private
- only accessible in the class in which it is defined 
- can be applied to: methods/attributes NOT CLASSES

default
- when you don't have any modier attached to an attribute
- 'package-private'
	- can access within the same package, but not outside of it
- can be applied to: classes, attributes, methods
- usefule for modular packages or self contained packages

protected
- can be accessed within the same package, or in inherited classes

final
- non inheritable
- applied to classes, and also methods
