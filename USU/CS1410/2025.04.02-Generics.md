Generics let us create methods and classes that can work with any type
- An issue we have had is multiple constructors that are overloaded to take ints or doubles or longs etc

```java
public class IntegerPrinter {
	private Integer thingToPrint;
	public IntegerPrinter(Integer thingToPrint){
		this.thingToPrint = thingToPrint;
	}
	public void print(){
		System.out.println(thingToPrint);
	}
}
```

Instead of having multiple classes with the same code above but for things like strings or doubles, we can do this
- Include a `<T>` right after the name of the class
	- `<T>` is convention because it stands for 'Type', but it can be anything. For example `penis` works

```java
public class Printer <T>{
	private T thingToPrint;
	public Printer(T thingToPrint){
		this.thingToPrint = thingToPrint;
	}
	public void print(){
		System.out.println(thingToPrint);
	}
}
```

We use this by specifying the type of the variable like so
- The brackets on the left side used to have to match the brackets on the right, but in newer version of java you can leave them empty

```java
public class GenericsExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Printer<Integer> printer = new Printer<>(5);
		
		ArrayList<Cat> cats = new ArrayList<>();
		cats.add(new Cat("Shorty"));
	}
}
```

Generics do not work with primitive data types! You have to use the reference data type, such as Integer instead of int
- This is because they must have an implementation of the .toString method, and primitives don't have this
- In the next notes, we see a line of text that is `System.out.printf("%s ", elem);` and it would not work for primitives because the line is implicitly calling the toString method

If you want to make sure your generic class only contains certain types of classes you would do this:
- Called a 'Bounded Type Parameter'

```java
public class Printer <T extends Animal> {

// Can also do this, where Animal is a Class and Comparable is an Interface
// You can have multiple Interfaces, but they have to go last
public class Printer <T extends Animal & Comparable> {
```

You can also include generics just for methods, and not for that other fancy shmancy stuff

```java
public static <E> void reportArray(E[] array) {
	// Convention to have 'E' as 'Elements', like how we have 'T' as 'Type'
	for (E elem : array){
		System.out.printf("%s ", elem);
	}
	System.out.println();
}
```
