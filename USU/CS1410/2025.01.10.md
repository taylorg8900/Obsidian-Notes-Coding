summary for today: review of the Scanner object in Java, and syntax for using conditionals compared to python. Also, switch statements were talked about for the first time which is a new tool we didn't have before

soutv shortcut
using Scanners
	typing Scanner and letting it autocomplete automatically imports java.util.Scanner
	1) declare type of variable as Scanner, in Scanner input = new Scanner(system.in)
	2) assign new var to be input.nextDouble or input.nextInt or something like that
	space is a delimiter for input, so if you have something like '1 2 3' typed in, each of those can be assigned to a new variable even though they are on the same line
conditionals
	have to be in parentheses
	use brackets for code block
	conventions
		having else if or else on the same line as the closing brackets for if statement
		having it on next line like a regular sane person
	elif is else if in java
switch statements
	just gonna paste it in for now
	switch (dayOfWeek){  
    case 1 -> {  
        System.out.println("Monday");  
        System.out.println("Garfield moment");  
    }  
    case 2 -> System.out.println("Tuesday");  
    case 3 -> System.out.println("Wednesday");  
    case 4 -> System.out.println("Thursday");  
    case 5 -> System.out.println("Friday");  
    case 6 -> System.out.println("Saturday");  
    case 7 -> System.out.println("Sunday");  
    default -> System.out.println("Not a day!");
    #important called match case in python
