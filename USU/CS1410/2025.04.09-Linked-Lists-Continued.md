Deleting elements
- We just set the node's pointer to the address of the next next node

```java
public void remove(E target){
	if (findtarget) != null){
		Node<E> current = this.head;
		
		while (current.next.data != target){
			current = current.next;
		}
		current.next = current.next.next;
	}
}
```

Inserting elements
- Set our node's pointer to whatever the current node's pointer is, then set the current node's pointer to our node

```java
public void insert(int position, E data){
	Node<E> newNode = new Node<>(data);
	
	// First see if we are inserting this node at the beginning
	if (position == 0){
		newNode.next = this.head;
		this.head = newNode;
	}
	else {
		Node<E> current = this.head;
		int indexCounter = 0;
		while (indexCounter < position - 1 && current.next != null){
			current = current.next;
			indexCounter++;
		}
		newNode.next = current.next;
		current.next = newNode;
	}
}
```

There were a couple other methods which weren't worth taking notes on, like finding the length of the linked list

What is a data structure that is inherently sorted?

next lecture we talk about how to actually make or do stuff with them

Everything on the left is smaller, everything on the right is bigger
