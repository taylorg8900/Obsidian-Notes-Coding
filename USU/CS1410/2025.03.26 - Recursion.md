Two things we always consider when dealing with recursion
1) Base case
	- What is the simplest subproblem to solve?
2) recursive call
	- How do we get closer to our base case?

My psuedocode for what the factorial function will probably look like
```
def factorial(number)
	if number = 1
		return 1
	return number * factorial(number - 1)
```

Call stack
- How recursive functions work
- For me, pretty intuitive. It just stacks function calls on top of each other until it hits the base case and then can work it's way back down all of the function calls that were created like stacking plates then unstacking them

Collatz conjecture
- Take a number. If it is even, divide it by 2. If it is odd, multipy by 3 and add 1. Stop when you hit 1

```java
public static void collatz(int num){
	// Our base case
	if (num == 1){
		System.out.rpintln("Hit 1");
	}
	// Two different recursive calls 
	else if(num % 2 == 0){
		System.out.printf("%d is even, so dividing by 2\n", num);
		collatz(num / 2);
	}
	else {
		System.oaut.printf("%d is odd, so multiplying by 3 and adding 1", num);
		collatz(3 * num + 1);
	}
}
```

Fibonacci
- Easier to implement with recursion than with a loop, apparently
- `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21`
- For example, saying `fib(1)` could be 0
- saying `fib(5)` could be 3
- also, saying `fib(3)` is the same as `fib(2) + fib(1)`

```java
public static int fibonacci(int n){
	// Return the nth fibonacci number

	// Base cases
	if (n == 0) return 0;
	if (n == 1) return 1;

	// Recursive call
	return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
```

# Memoization and Dynamic Programming
Not covered in this lecture, but an honorable mention because it stores values somehow to speed up recursive calls. Sounds cool
