topics: Searching and Sorting

# modifying arrays
using a method
- pass by reference, not by value like with ints and such things
- this is because they are **mutable** 
- ints are immutable for example, so they get passed by value

# search algorithms
linear search
- Big O of (n)

binary search
- big O of log(n)

# sorting algorithms
bubble sort  
my idea of how it works
```
for element i in arr
	for element j in arr[start to end - i]
		if arr[j] > arr[j + 1] 
			swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
```
teachers version
```
didSwap;
do while didSwap is false
	didSwap = false
	for i in array
		if array[i] > array[i + 1]
			swap them
			didSwap = true
```

selection sort
my idea of how it works
```
for element i in arr
	find smallest i in arr with for loop
	swap arr[i] with smallest i
```
