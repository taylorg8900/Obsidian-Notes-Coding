Interfaces are another inheritcane deal, something that lets you connect things

Abstract classes
- basically set up so that another class can extend from it, like a template
- blueprint
- never instantiated
- `abstract` keyword makes it so you can't create that object / instantiate it

abstract methods
- no implementation
- forces subclass to override particular method (gives syntax error if you don't implement that method in the subclass)

Interfaces
- provide a structure for how a class should be without ANY code inside, compared to abstract classes which might have some abstract methods and some concrete methods
- classes that inherit from interfaces can inherit from multiple interfaces
- instead of saying `extends` we say `implements` when inheriting
