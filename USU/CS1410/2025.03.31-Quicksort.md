# Sorting
We have seen three sorting algorithms so far
- Bubble sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

Quick Sort
- Standard sorting algorithm for java
- This is not merge sort from CS5050!!!

We are talking about sorting algorithms as a proxy to learn other concepts such as time complexity, space complexity, recursion, etc

How does Quicksort work
1) Partition
	- You basically walk through an array and if there are any elements which are less than the very last value, put them on the left and at the end swap the last value with whatever value you ended on. This way, every element on the left of where the last value gets placed is less than it, and everything on the right is greater than it. Then you just keep doing that recursively and it will sort the array

```java
public class QuicksortDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] numbers = {8, 3, 6, 2, 9, 1, 5, 4, 7};
		// The first result is a demonstration of the partition
		// Second result is a fully sorted list using quickSort
		report(numbers);
		partition(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1);
		report(numbers);
		quickSort(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1):
		report(numbers);
	}
	public static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high){
		int pivot = arr[high];
		// i will mark the boundary of elements smaller than the pivot
		// elements smaller than the pivot will go to the left of i
		int i = low - 1;
		// March j along until the pivot
		for(int j = low; j < high; j++){
			if (arr[j] < pivot){
				i++;
				swap(arr, i, j);
			}
		}
		swap(arr, i + 1, high);
		// Return where the pivot value landed
		return i + 1;
	}
	public static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j){
		// Swap elements at indices i and j
		int temp = arr[i];
		arr[i] = arr[j];
		arr[j] = temp;
	}
	public static void report(int [] array){
		for (int num : array){
			System.out.printf("%d ", num);
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
	public static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high){
		if (low < high){
			int pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high);
			// Recursively quicksort the left and right side of the pivot
			quickSort(arr, low, pivotIndex - 1); // Left side
			quickSort(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high); // Right side
		}
	}
}
```
