## exam review
```java
String str1 = "hello"
String str2 = str1;
str1 = str1 + " World";

System.out.println(str1)
System.out.println(str2)
```
The line `str1 = str1 + "World"` creates a new object, so the pointers are not pointing to the same place in memory anymore. Str1 is something new entirely now

Lists are the only things that are mutable, Strings are not

```java
double candyBars = 11.5;
int students = 3;
double each = candyBars / students;

System.out.printf("%10s: %.0f candy bars\n", "Bill", each);
System.out.printf("%10s: %.0f candy bars\n", "Charles", each);
```
`%10s` means it is output in a 10 character wide column
`%.0f` means it is rounded UP to 0 decimal places .


```java
double x = 123.45;
int y = x;
```
This doesn't work because you can't implicity convert a double to an int. You can explicitly convert it by saying:
```java
double x = 123.45
int y = (int) x;
```


# Classes

Packages

syntax for using Classes
- name of class, name of var, then '= new'
- `Random rng = new Random();`
- the `rng` is a reference to this object, so like how a variable for a String is a pointer to it sort of

Creating a class
- can only have one Public class with that specific name
- only one class per file
- doesn't use the psvm thing

Attributes
- looks like `private int age;`
- private keyword for all attributes (for now) is the convention so nothing is accessible outside of the class

Constructors
- allow you to define how you create an object of a class
- use 'this' instead of 'self'
```java
public class Person {
	private String name;
	
	public Person(String initialName){
		this.name = initialName;
	}
}
```

UML
- class diagrams
- exist here too rip
- defines attributes and methods
