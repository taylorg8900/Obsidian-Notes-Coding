method which will compare two objects and see if they are the same, custom method
```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o){
	if (o instanceof Shape){
		return this.getArea() == ((Shape) o ).getArea();
	}
	return false;
}
```

How do we make it so we can compare two objects instead of just seeing if they are equal or not?
 - Interfaces

Java has an interface already called 'Comparable' that we can use, and it has a method called 'compareTo' that you must implement in any class you use it for

```java
public abstract class Shape implements Comparable {
	@Override
	public int compareTo(Object o){
		// Return 0 if the objects are the same
		// Return a negative number if this object < another object
		// Return a positive number if this object > other object
		Shape s = (Shape) o;
		if (this.equals(o)){
			return 0;
		}
		else if (this.getArea() < s.getArea()){
			return -1;
		}
		else {
			return 1;
		}
	}
}
```

This is useful because when you combine it with polymorphism, you can use it in other ways with different objects
```java
public static void sortThings(Comparable[] data){
	for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
		for (int j = 0; j < data.length - 1; j++){
			//compare data[j] and data[j + 1]
			// if they are out of order, swap them
			// if data[j] is larger than data[j + 1] swap
			if (data[j].compareTo(data[j + 1]) > 0){
				Comparable temp = data[j];
				data[j] = data[j + 1];
				data[j + 1] = temp;
			}
		}}
}
```

We will talk more about this later when we cover Generics, but for now lets leave it how it is

# recursion

ATM analogy
![[2025.03.24 recursion example.PNG]]

anytime you have a method that calls itself

parts you need for recursion
1. Base Case - What is the condition for stopping this function? Must get you closer to the base case
2. Recursive call - If the base case was 'if', this is the 'else'
