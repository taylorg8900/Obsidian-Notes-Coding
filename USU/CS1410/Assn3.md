### functions
printer functions
	theres a few that just print out information, depending on arguments that are passed in, seems easy enough
boolean functions
	just check to see if a coordinate is within a circle or rectangle, uses 6 arguments (2 being coordaintes of point, 4 being coordinates to describe circle/rectangle)
		this means there are no rectangle/circle objects
		this assignment is just about writing functions, and having them return values back to us

coordinates
	left / right, top / bottom
	left and right would be X coordinates, top / bottom would be Y coordinates
