# static
static attributes are associated with a class rather than instances of a class
`private static int population = 0;`

methods that are static cannot be accessed from an instance of the class, have to be referenced from the class itself
- difference between making a new Random() object, and just calling Math.random()

# getter methods
same as in python, where you return the value of a class in a method so you can access it if you need to without making it public

shotcut for making these: don't type out the `public int ...` part, just type out `get` and java will automatically create a method for you if you autocomplete

# printing classes
instead of having some method named `printPerson` or something, we can change the default behavior of an objects string representation

do it by creating a `toString` method, java automatically knows this is a special method which is cool
- this is because in the object class in java, there is a method called toString which is used unless we make our own (overriding)
- can look at other methods for classes by clicking the little bullseye next to the method
```java
public String toString(){
	return ....
}
```

# overloaded constructors
same as overloading functions, if you want multiple ways of constructing an instance of a class
```java
public Person(String initialName) {  
    this.age = 0;  
    this.name = initialName;  
    population++;  
}  
  
public Person(String initialName, int initialAge){  
    this.age = initialAge;  
    this.name = initialName;  
    population++;  
}
```

however it is better not to repeat code, and we can call one method inside of another with Constructor Chaining
```java
public Person(String initialName) {  
    this(initialName, 0);  
}  
  
public Person(String initialName, int initialAge){  
    this.age = initialAge;  
    this.name = initialName;  
    population++;  
}
```
