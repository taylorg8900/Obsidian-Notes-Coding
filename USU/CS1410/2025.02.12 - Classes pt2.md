# constructors
you don't need to say `this.variable` in the constructor, you can just say `variable` because of scope but i guess it is better to do it the first way for consistency

# defining methods
for now we don't use static inside of the classes, we will talk about what that is later on (it is probably because we are dealing with an instance of the class in this example, so we don't need it)
```java
public void printPerson() {  
    System.out.printf("%s, age %d years", this.name, this.age);  
}
```

# changing attributes with methods
pretty much just set up a function inside the method to update the private variable in the class, just like in python. pretty simple. you'd want to do this to introduce logic so that the values of variables are restricted, on top of not letting it be changed easily in the first place

# static
why does static exist?
- sometimes we want to tie things to the class itself and not instances of it
- `public static int population = 0;`

can't access static variables through instances of the class
- would instead have to access it by the class name, like `Person.population`
