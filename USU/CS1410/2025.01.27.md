# stepwise refinement
steps
	call functions that don't even exist, that you are planning on doing some piece of the final project

shortcuts
	creating methods / functions
		right click on function that doesn't exist, can create it automatically to avoid typing
		will automatically know what type to return, and the arguments to pass in
	implementation
		right click on a method usage and find out where it was created to look at the code

question
	why is every method public and not private? why does it matter?
		- something about them being available, and something bout when we make our own classes?
