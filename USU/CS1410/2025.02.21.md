String.valueOf() method to turn ints into string representations

can use classes as an attribute in another class
- Clock and ClockHand classes program

```java
public class Clock {  
    private ClockHand hours;  
    private ClockHand minutes;  
    private ClockHand seconds;  
  
    public Clock(){  
        hours = new ClockHand(24);  
        minutes = new ClockHand(60);  
        seconds = new ClockHand(60);  
    }
}
```

# class relationships
association
- 'weak link'
- independaent, but can be used together
- when two classes are related and one class is present in another

aggregation
- 'has a '
- exists when there is a stronger link between classes, and typicall ythe 'outer class' aggregates the 'inner class'
- basically just a stronger version of association, where the relationship is a little more dependant

composition
- clock and clockhand example
- implies ownership
- one cannot exist without the other

# primitive vs reference data types
primitives
- ints, doubles, bools, floats, etc
- compared by their value: example  `x == y` 

reference data types
- anything that is not a primitive
- stores memory address of the data
- compared by their memory address
	- .equals() method to compare reference data types

any primitive has a reference data types 'wrappers'
```
int x = 5;
Integer y = 10;
```

# autoboxing
somehow saying `int f = 500; Integer b = f;` is 'boxing' 

i guess it's like typecasting from primitive data types to their wrapper reference data types
