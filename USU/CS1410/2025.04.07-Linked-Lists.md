# Data Structures

### Java Collections Framework
- An inheritance hierarchy that explains what different data structures we can use (There are more, but I don't think are being covered here)
- Iterable Interface
	- Collection Interface inherits from Iterable
		- List Interface inherits from Collection
			- ArrayList Class implements List
			- Vector Class implements List
				- Stack Class implements Vector
			- LinkedList Class implements List
		- Queue Interface inherits from Collection
		- Set Interface inherits from Collection

Why do we need Data Structures?
- Certain operations are faster/slower in certain data structures

### Node
- What linked lists are made of, just a container for some piece of data
- Stores a reference to another node (can be null)

```java
public class Node <E>{
	public E data;
	public Node<E> next;
	
	public Node(E data){
		this.data = data;
	}
	
	@Override
	public String toString(){
		return this.data.toString();
	}
}

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Node<Integer> headNode = new Node<>(1);
	}
}

public class LinkedList <E> {
	private Node<E> head;
}
```

Inserting elements
- The definition given in class is to add it to the end of the list, but I feel like that isn't the best way to do it cuz if the list was a million elements long it would take forever to get there
	- Maybe we could use `static` to keep track of the tail's position or something idk

```java
public class LinkedList <E> {
	private Node<E> head;
	
	public void add(e data){
		Node<E> newNode = new Node<>(data);
		
		// Empty list, initialize first element to head
		if (head == null){
			head = newNode;
		}
		else {
			Node<E> current = head;
			// Traverse until we hit the last element
			while (current.next != null){
				current = current.next;
			}
			current.next = newNode;
		}
	}
	
	public void print(){
		
		Node<E> current = head;
		
		while(current != null){
			System.out.print(current + " ");
			current = current.next;
		}
	}
}
```

Finding Elements
- We can use `implements List` to see all of the methods available to any class that implements the List interface in Java

```java
public Node<E> find(E data){
	node<E> current = head;
	while (current != null){
		if (current.data.equals(data)){
			return current;
		}
		current = current.next;
	}
	return null;
}
```
