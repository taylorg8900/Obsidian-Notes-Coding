summary for today: talking a lot about Strings in java. You can't compare two strings directly because the variables assigned to them are actually pointers. Talked about printf, and that you can perform certain methods on the placeholders as well


input.next();
	automatically knows space is a delimiter, can assign strings using this
	like string 1 string 2 string 3 for one long sentence as input.next();
input.nextLine();
	the entire input is one big string, spaces included
pointers
	a variable assigned to a string is really just a pointer, so comparing two strings using == will never work because memory addresses are different
equals() method
	use to compare two strings
	equalsIgnoreCase() also 
typecasting
	.parse methods on things
	example used in class:
		int value = Integer.parseInt(s1);
printf
	can specify amount of decimal places with %.2f, ie having a decimal in between the % and f in %f
	can specify amount of spaces total by having a number on the left of the decimal, says how big the field is going to be 
		%10.2f
		say %-10.2f makes it 'left justified' instead of 'right justified'
	%d for digit
	%f for float
	can include the %d or whatever in a STring before the printf statement
