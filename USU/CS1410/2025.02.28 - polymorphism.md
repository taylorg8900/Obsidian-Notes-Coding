subclasses inherit all public attributes + methods except for constructors

constructor chaining
```java
public Person(String name){  
    this(name, 0);  
}  
public Person (String name, int age){  
    this.name = name;  
    this.age = age;  
}
```

constructor chaining using the parent class
```java
public Professor(String name, int age, String researchTopic){  
    super(name, age);  
    this.researchTopic = researchTopic;  
}
```

# polymorphism
a single variable can 'be' more than one type
	- basically subclasses are both their own class, and the class they are inheriting from at the same timeljdlfajd
