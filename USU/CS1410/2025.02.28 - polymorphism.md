subclasses inherit all public attributes + methods except for constructors

constructor chaining
```java
public Person(String name){  
    this(name, 0);  
}  
public Person (String name, int age){  
    this.name = name;  
    this.age = age;  
}
```

constructor chaining using the parent class
```java
public Professor(String name, int age, String researchTopic){  
    super(name, age);  
    this.researchTopic = researchTopic;  
}
```

# polymorphism
a single variable can 'be' more than one type
- basically subclasses are both their own class, and the class they are inheriting from at the same time
- for example this lets you construct an array of type parent class and stick a bunch of inherited subclasses into it and it will work

```java
Person charles = new Professor("Charles", 0, "literature");
```
what methods are available
- only the methods defined in the person class
- however if you call a method that is overriden in the subclass, the overriden method will be used instead

# dynamic binding
compiler basically doesnt know which method to call until it is actually ran, so you can use different objects of different classes which are inherited as the argument
- 'compiler doesnt know which getname() method to call until it is ran'

# casting classes
can explicitly cast an object to another class such as:
```java
Person charles = new Professor("Charles",0, "lit");
Professor x = (Professor) charles;
x.writePaper(); //method only in the Professor class, not Person
```

how to check if an object is an instance of a certain class
```java
if (babbage instanceof Professor){
	...
}
```
