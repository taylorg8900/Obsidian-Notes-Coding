important stuff to remember
	Scanner class
	declaring data types for variables
	shortcuts like 'sout' and 'psvm'

naming conventions for files and src
	#term camel case
	example would be exampleName for classes
'strongly typed language'
	have to declare data type for each variable just like in C
	types 
		byte
		short (2 bytes)
		int (4 bytes)
		long (8 bytes)
		float ( 4 bytes)
		double (8 bytes)
		boolean (1 byte)
		char (2 bytes)
string concatenation
	can add different data types together if printing
creating new objects
	have to preface with 'new', in python didnt need anything prefacing declaration
java.util.Scanner
	declaring variable using the Scanner class has a lot of methods attached to it
	input.nextDouble();
#shortcut sout = System.out.println();
#shortcut psvm = public static void main(String\[] args);
