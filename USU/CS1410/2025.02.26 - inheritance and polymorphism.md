review of last lecture
- every object implicity has `extends Object`, which means they all have things like toString() method

fixing repeated code with toString
- take the output of toString from the superclass, and concatenate extra info to it
```java
return super.toString() + String.format(" Subject: %s", this.subject);
```

# making inherited constructors
rules
- when we dont define a constructor we get a default constructor
- subclasses will by default always call the default constructor of the superclass
- we can create our own default constructors that have defined behaviour
- when we create a constructor with parameters, we dont get a default constructor unless we explicity define it
- subclasses must call a super class constructor as the very first thing they do in their own constructor

if you dont call the superclass' constructor, java will implicitly call the default constructor if it exists
