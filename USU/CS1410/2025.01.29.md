# constants
preface data type with 'final'
	'final double PI = 3.14159;'

# postfix / preface operators
example of a postfix operator
	x++;
can also do this:
	++x;
how are they different?
	postfix returns the original value and then adds one
	prefix adds one, then returns original value
	for example, saying println(x++) wouldn't print out x + 1, but println(++x) would

# type conversions
implicit example: adding a double and an int together doesn't break everything
	called a #term widening conversion
	basically int -> float -> double, never double -> float -> int, because then it would be a lossy conversion
converting numbers -> String
	String.valueOf() method
		example: String x = String.valueOf(a);
converting String -> number
	Integer.parseInt(Str);

# arrays
how to make them
	1) declare type
	2) say new 'type'
	3) add square brackets after, with the size of the array inside the brackets
	example: double\[] myList = new double\[6];
methods
	.length
		example: myList.length (don't need the () after, i guess)
another way to make them
	1) instead of saying new double\[6], say \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
	example: double\[] myList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# enhanced for loop
for looping over elements in an array
same as saying 'for i in list' in python pretty much

	for (Integer i : myList) {
		System.out.println(myList[i]);
	}

what it would look like without being fancy

	for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) {
		System.out.println(myList[i]);
	}

# copying arrays
steps
	1) set second array length to be equal to first array
		1) int\[] secondList = new int\[firstList.length];
	2) copy every element from first list to second
method to do it
	System.arraycopy(SRC, srcPOSITION, DEST, destPOS, numELEMENTS);
