more exam review same notes as last time

things i get wrong here >
- dynamic binding
	- when you create a program in java and you have a method, java needs to figure out which method it is actually going to run when it gets called (overloading and such)
	- basically it won't figure out which actual object method will get called until runtime hence the dynamic part
- constructors are NOT inherited by subclasses
	- ever
	- if you want a default constructur you need to make one and call super() on it
- checked exception
	- must be declared or handled explicitly
	- program won't compile until you do something about it

topics here >
- Object Class
- polymorphism
- method overloading
- instanceof 
	- `System.out.println(object1 instanceof class1);`
	- this would print a bool either true or false
- ArrayList
- exception handling
- creating new exception and throwing them
- checked exception


Actually did not go over interfaces today
