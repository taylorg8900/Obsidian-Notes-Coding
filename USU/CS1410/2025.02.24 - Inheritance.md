Strings are immutable, as seen here; You can't do replace() on the first string :(
```java
String s1 = "This is a test of Java Strings";  
String s1 = s1.replace("e", "whatdahellohmygodnowayyeayeayyeea");  
System.out.println(s1);
```

using split() like in python
```java
String[] words = s1.split(" ");

for (String word : words){
	System.out.println(word);
}
```

constructing f strings before using print on them
```java
String formattedStr = String.format("This is an integer: %d and this is a double: %.2f", 10, 3.14159);

System.out.println(formattedStr);
```

can use this in toString inside of classes as well
```java
return String.format("%s, age %d years", this.name, this.age);
```

# inheritance fr
---
why do we use it?
- duplicated code = die
- want to use the structure of another already made class in a new one

> java.lang.Object
>- yeah so all classes are objects i guess 
>- implements the `toString` method
>
>Class Person
>- has name and age attributes
>- overwrites the toString method
>
>Class Student
>- inherit the name and age attributes from Person
>- override the toString method

also pretty much when you make an object it automatically inherits the toString method since it is an object and that is just what it is
- every object is a super object
- class hierarchy
	- Object (defined by java) > Classes we make -> we can use methods provided by Objects in every class 

Java will choose the method closes to the actual object in the hierarchy, when you use toString() in a class you made where toString() got remade, it will automatically call that one instead of the Object toString method

## annotations

`@Override` tells compiler you are the boss and have the last say here brah, it is a convention, and also will give you an error if you mispelled the method name you are tryna override so it is good to include to make sure you are actually overriding what you think you are
```java
@Override
public String toString(){
	stuff in here
}
```

Superclass: parent class

Subclass: child class

Subclasses inherit from superclasses, like java.lang.Object > Person

## making a subclass

example: `public class Teacher extends Person{`

avoid duplicated code with this one weird trick
```
super.toString() + .....
```
