	what psvm is
class methods(?)
	like functions
	public static void NAMEOFMETHOD() {
return type
	void
	have to specify just like how you have to declare data type for variables
arguments
	in parentheses duh
	also have to declare type for what is to be expected as an argument
method overloading (or overwriting)
	can have two methods with the same name, but different parameters

returning
	public static TYPE NAMEOFMETHOD() {}
