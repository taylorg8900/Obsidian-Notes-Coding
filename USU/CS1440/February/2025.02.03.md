sidenotes
- multiple cursors trick in vim might exist in pycharm and other editors
# files
open function
- `f = open("README.md")`
- f acts as the file object
read function
- `f.read(20)` would read 20 bytes from the file, which we would use something like `print(f.read(20))` to see 
- calling more read() functions will continue from where it left off, it leaves a cursor in the file essentially
- `f.readline()` is a built in method in python where it will read an entire line at once
- only saying `f.read()` will return the entire file as a String file, which is really bad and called "slurping", if the file is bigger than your RAM then its ggs
- What happens if you try to read another file with `f.readline()` if you are already at the end of the file?
	- it just returns an empty string, nothing happens
- if you want to read a line again:
	- `seek` method, which we wont use in this class
	- close file and reopen it
- what if you try to read from a closed file object
	- `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.`
-  

```python
for line in f:
	print(line, end="")
```
This code block: python knows if you use this syntax, to read each line from the file. You are treating the file like a list or a tuple, and each element is a line in this pseudo list

# assignment 2
just talking about how its gonna go down
- can see all of this in the repo, so no need to take notes here
- also dont worry about exception handling
- also DONT USE the `with` keyword when opening files either, it is better to not rely on it
