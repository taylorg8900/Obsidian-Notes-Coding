# demo: make a dictionary from a tsv file
evreything is built into python

```python
students = {}
f = open('favorite_colors.dat')
f.readline() # discard the header line
for line in f:
	# rstrip returns a str copy with trailing whitespaces removed
	# strip, lstrip also available
	
	fields = line.rstrip().split('\t')
	students[fields[0]] = fields[1]
	
	
f.close()
```

print the number of pairs in the dictionary 'students'
```python
print(len(students))
```

prints pairs one by one, by key
```python
for key in students:
	print(f"{key} likes {students[key]}")
```

print only certain keys
```python
print(f"Boston likes {students['Boston']}")
```

safely check whether a key exists
```python
if 'Erik' in students:
	...
```
safely retrive a value from 'students', getting a default otherwise
- default value is 'beige' if the value doesn't exist
```python
print(f"Erik likes {students.get('Erik', 'Beige')}")
```
