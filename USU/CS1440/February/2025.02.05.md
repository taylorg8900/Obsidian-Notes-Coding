## repl flags
-i
- import
- example: `python -i src/Usage.py` will open the repl and also import Usage.py

## processes and programs
basically programs are just sitting around and processes got copied into memory and are being ran by the computer

## paths

path
- a unique string that identifies where a file is, leading from the root location, which would be like the C drive or something

file separator
- the character that delimits directories and files from each other
- on unix it is a front slash `/`
- on windows it is a back slash `\` but can also use a front slash most of the time
- basically dont worry about back slashes in the upcoming assignment

absolue path
- contains all of the info needed to locate a file or directory

relative path
- incomplete
- has to be combined with a process's CWD to form the absolute path
- the sequence `..` refers to the parent directory

best practices
- dont ever assume the user is trying to open the file from a already known location 
- just do `f = open(sys.argv[1])`

## command line args
yeah already know what this is

how to import in python: `import sys` and then use `sys.argv`
