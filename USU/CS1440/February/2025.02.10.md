## how to use help in python

in the repl: type help(SOMETHING) 
- for example `help([])` or `help(str)`
- usually you can just scroll past the dunder methods
- you CAN pass in the argument as just some kind of variable, and the help thing will figure out the correct documentation based on what type the variable is
	- for example this will pull up documentation for file objects
	- a = open(file)
	- help(a)
- you can also just call `help()` in the repl, not sure where this is useful but i know it is, you exit by saying `exit`

## software plan
It is useful because it brings up issues that you will run into anyway, but earlier in development in a way that lets you deal with it more easily
