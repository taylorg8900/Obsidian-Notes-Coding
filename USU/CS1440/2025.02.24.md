might not have to include `-i` argument when calling the repl with a python file? Erik didn't which is interesting

unzip file
- unzip ~/donwloads/FILENAME 
- doesn't work on windows :(

running tt.py from command li nne - using your own text tools on this assignment
- shell will look through locations of a command, and you can put yours in there
- $PATH
- add the directory containing your command to path
- `echo $PWD` shows you current directory path
- PATH uses colons to separate paths
- want something that looks like `echo $PWD:$PATH`
- `PATH=$PWD:$PATH` 
- more detailed instructions somewher in current project, to make changes to $PATH stay between loads of the shell 

diff
- compares two text files and shows you difference between them
