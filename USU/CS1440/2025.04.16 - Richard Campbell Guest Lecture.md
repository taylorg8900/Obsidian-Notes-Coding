The point of this lecture is getting someone else in here that uses their computer in a different way. This guy uses the terminal like a pro apparently - "Using the terminal advantageously"

I have the pdf in the notes from the class that I git pull regularly, so look in `[sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes]` and today's date

The most important things to show potential employers
- Good troubleshooting skills
- Curiosity about computers
	- Not using the defaults in every place, showing that you experiment is a good sign

How did bro get his jobs?
- He knew linux
	- He didn't even apply for the job, he was just some guy in a room that knew how to use linux to solve a problem
	- Every single company uses a linux server, so this opens doors quickly
- He provided fixes for bugs he submitted
	- He basically found a bug, would find out what caused it, and then submit a report saying how to fix it

ssh is how you can remotely grab a file off of another computer and take it
- sounds like git, right?

You should find something that is better, not something that is the best
