Four main principles
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Encapsulation
- 'Information hiding'
- keeping everything in one place hides details, and makes bug hunting easier too 
- Keep details that aren't really important to know private and tucked away, like attributes and such

Abstraction
- Idea of simplifying things so they are must easier to deal with
- Tip - use good vocabulary for methods so it isn't confusing for people trying to use your class

Inheritance
- Telling the computer that something is basically the same thing but with a few small different details
- In python, you define inheritance by placing the super class name in parentheses after the subclass name
- Can call superclass's methods with `super().method_name()`
```
from superclass import SuperClassName
class SubClassName(SuperClassName):
	pass
	
```
- Manually calling an initializer of a superclass looks like:
```
def __init__(self):
	super().__init__() # Initialize attributes of superclass
	self.whatever = something # Create new attributes that don't exist in the superclass
```

Frequently misunderstood aspects of inheritance
- Ownership != inheritance
	- One object owning another is called aggregation
- Being made out of != inheritance
	- One object being built of other objects is called composition
