builtins
- useful in the REPL because you don't need to create variables to find out what they hold, like doing this: `len = len(list)` because now you can't use the len() function anymore without restarting the REPL


Functional programming

Object Oriented Programming

Real World objects
- What makes an object an object?
	- Something that has some characteristics (properties, attributes)
	- According to Erik, something that has a boundary in space or time. Objects possess a state and behavior. Objects can be made of other objects

Software System Objects
- Created back in the day to represent real world objects, which was hard to do with low level languages like C
- What is an object (in this context)?
	- A collection of data that can perform behaviors. Attributes = data/state, methods = behavior

How do programmers manage the complexity caused by having lots of software objects?
- Just because we have objects, doesn't mean that problems are manageable now
- Keep track of **state**, which are attributes
- Have **behaviors**, which are methods

Classification
- 'The process of grouping related pieces of data together with behaviors'
