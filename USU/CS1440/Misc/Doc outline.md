# Software Development Plan  
  
Phase 0: Requirements Analysis  
------------------------------  
*(20% of your effort)*  
  
**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.  
  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.  
  *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!  
  *   Don't leave out details!  
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.  
  *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.  
  *   List what you already know how to do.  
  *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.  
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.  
*   [ ] Explain what form the program's output will take.

Phase 1: Design  
---------------  
*(30% of your effort)*  
  
**Important - do not change the starter code in this phase.**  Feel free to write prototype files and experiment in the REPL, but it's too early to work on the starter code now.  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works in plain language.  
  *   Pseudocode != Python.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.  
  *   Describe important functions and classes in your program.  Include such details as:  
        *   Names of functions/classes  
        *   Parameter names and their types  
        *   Types of data returned by functions  
*   [ ] Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.  
  *   As you think of specific examples, write them under **Phase 3** so you can run them as soon as the program is functional.

Phase 2: Implementation  
-----------------------  
*(15% of your effort)*  
  
**Finally, you can write code!**  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] Working code in the `src/` folder.  
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.  
  *   e.g. what you learned, what didn't go according to plan.

Phase 3: Testing and Debugging  
------------------------------  
*(30% of your effort)*  
  
Your grade depends on how your program performs when run from the command line.  We don't use PyCharm to grade, so ensure your program runs correctly from the shell.  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.  
  *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.  
  *   Include a description of what happened for *each test case*.  
  *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
  
Phase 4: Deployment  
-------------------  
*(5% of your effort)*  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.  
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.  
  *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.  
  *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.  
  *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.  
  *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.  
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.  
    *  Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**  
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.  
  *   Check that your documentation files are all present.

Phase 5: Maintenance  
--------------------  
  
Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.  
  
Deliver:  
  
*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:  
  *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?  
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?  
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?  
  *   Will your documentation make sense to...  
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?  
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?  
  *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?  
  *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...  
        *   ...your computer's hardware?  
        *   ...the operating system?  
        *   ...to the next version of Python?  
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.  
*   [ ] Respond to the **Project Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
