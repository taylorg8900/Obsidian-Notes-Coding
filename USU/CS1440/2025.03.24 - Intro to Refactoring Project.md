Refactoring
- paying off technical debt, like untangling spaghetti
- Don't change things or fix bugs or add features, just rewrite code so it is more readable and not as messy
- Want to make things easier to understand but still do exactly the same thing
- A user would not be able to tell a difference between before / after

data folder
- phoenix fractals are meant to be used with files that start with 'p' in the data/ folder, like p-monkey-knife-fight.frac
- mandelbrot are the same, meant to be used with files that start with 'm' 
- in each file, there is an iterations number that is meant to be used by the program (which it currently isn't)

req analysis phase
- study codumentation, source code, instructions, catalog all code smells
- just try to figure out what is going on for certain sections of code and write that down

when refactoring
- use git branches a lot to try things out 
- make lots of really small commits
- main branch is like a safety line while rock climbing

making backup for all images while in req analysis
- `cp p-feathers.png p-feathers.bak.png`
- `diff p-feathers.*`
- will probably just eyeball differences though in pycharm, looks like `diff` and `feh` don't work for me like for erik

interactive.py
- just used to demonstrate the double for loop thing that is used to figure out the colors for the fractals

tkinter
- the GUI for this program
- works out of the box on every OS that can run python
- uses widgets, puts them on a window

tips for requirements analysis
- turn chunks of poorly written code into pseudocode so it is easier to understand and implement later
- the comments provided are not always helpful  so you can delete them or change them depending on the situation

other tips
- make a backup for the output of all of the working programs, and use diff on them when you introduce changes to know if you made a mistake
