What i would do for this really bad code
- turn each 'section' into a function 
- whatever is up with the `v=xax[0]....` thing should definitely be it's own function 

How Erik refactors
- keep all the information about tkinter completely separate

Yeah so the lecture was just taking a really shitty piece of code and refactoring it so it is more modular, self contained, and organized
