Difference between a Class and a Module
- Class
	- declared with `class`
	- is a datatype, distinct from other types of data (ints, strings, etc)
	- associates pieces of data (attributes) with methods
	- has an initializer method, sets up the object's attributes
- Module
	- just a plain `.py` file
	- contains variables, functions, classes

Other things about modules
- import entire module by saying `import math`
	- functions from this module are called with `math.FUNCTION_NAME`
- import specific functions from a module by saying `from math import cos`
- You can see all of the identifiers in the module (functions, variables, etc) by printing the output of `dir(math)`, which is easier in the REPL

Designing a Good Class
- Has a meaningful and cohesive purpose
- Its name accurately and concisely represents a typical instance of the class
- Its attributes are closely related to its purpose
- Its methods rely primarily on its own attributes for ther computation

How to design a class
- Think about the purpose of the class in the system
	- if it is too complicated or diverse consider splitting the class
- Give the class a descriptive but concise name
	- if you have trouble with this you might need to reconsider its purpose
- Consider the types of attributes and methods that are common to all instances of the class

How to notice when you should make a class
- Look for key nouns and noun phrases in a description of a system, and consider them as potential classes
- Group features and logic that are closely related

## Principles of OOP

Four main principles
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Encapsulation
- Organizing related code together into one package
- "Good fences make good neighbours"
- When struggling to figure out where to draw the line and decide what belongs where, try to consider the *internal complexity* from *external complexity*
	- Every piece of information that someone doesn't really need to know to use your class is external. Things that do not fit this description should be kept on the inside of the class
	- Try to reduce the cognitive burden of someone who is trying to use your class by minimizing the amount of information that can be seen from the outside of the class
	- *external complexity* are things like method names, what arguments are put into them, what they give back
	- *internal complexity* are things like attributes, how methods work
- Code smell for having one object that does everything / too much is called having a god object
