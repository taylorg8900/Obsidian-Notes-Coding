Creating the main module
- look for the keywords `phoenix` or `mbrot` in sys.argv, and then run the appropriate function based on that.
- Don't use startswith method because it won't work with relative paths

Non Functional Attributes
- parts of the program that aren't really a feature the customer would ask for
- take a backseat to the set of capabilities that the customer expects
- things like
	- number of lines of code
	- how readable the code is
	- how easy it is to locate and fix bugs

Refactoring and adding functionality together
- NEVER DO THIS
- it makes it way harder to pin down where something went wrong
- it is always better to make very small changes and push them separately
