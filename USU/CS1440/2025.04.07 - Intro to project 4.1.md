Notes about next projects
- Need to create our own color palettes
- `.frac` files are now going to actually use the iteration and pixel size information

Continuing from [[2025.04.04 - Encapsulation Applied]]

Inheritance applied
- Due to python's name mangling behavior, attributes and methods in a superclass that start with double underscores `(__)` are not accessible from subclasses
	- You can see the messed up names in error messages 
	- Therefore, change 'private' attributes from having two underscores, to just one
	- Just having a single underscore reminds other programmers to treat methods and attributes as though they are still private
	- Setting attributes to private or public isn't really required in python, it is more of a suggestion because you can very easily find out what the attributes or methods are called even if they are 'private'
- As a review, inheritance looks like this: `class Fib(Sequence)`

Polymorphism
- Python does 'duck typing', which means it won't figure out what to do with your code until you run it
- What we will use with our color palettes 
- 'differently shaped pegs all fit into a round shaped hole'
- `raise NotImplementedError("You must define this method in your subclass")` to fake abstraction in python
	- 'Poison pill' method
