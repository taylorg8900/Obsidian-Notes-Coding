How do we reuse code across projects, and not just inside one with things like inheritance and oop?

Five strategies for code reuse:
- Cutting and pasting
- Abstract data types
	- Talked about way back in the day having data structures like linked lists as punch cards that you put into the machine, which I guess is like importing functions from other files
- Software libraries
	- Like python's standard library
- Algorithms
	- Written in pseudocode
	- Lets you translate it into whichever code you are programming in, since libraries are not going to be written for every single language
- Design patterns
	- General solution to a generic problem
	- Algorithms are more specific
	- Higher level of abstraction, says how you are organizing things

### Using `pathlib.Path` to find the stem of a path

If you wanted to find the file name without an extension of some path, you could create a custom algorithm that does the following:
1. Split the path into its directory and file name components
2. Remove the extension from the file name

```python
# this will fail on some computers since we aren't capable of handling backslashes
def path_to_stem(path):
	filename = path.split("/")[-1]
	return filename[:filename.rfind(".")]
```

Since using a custom function isn't really worth it, we instead do this
```python
from pathlib import Path
stem = Path("../data/8-points.frac").stem
print("Unix-style filename->stem =", stem)
stem = Path(r"../data/8-points.frac").stem
print("Windows-style filename->stem =", stem)
```

### Pip

Stands for ''Python install package"

We will use this to create our dynamic color palette for the project, since someone already wrote code to generate an array of colors that is as long as we want it to be

Installing the `colour` module
- `python -m pip install --user colour`

In pycharm when we accidentally import modules, it will run pip and go get them without you noticing

Since some modules import other libraries, when you pip install something you might get like 20 libraries installed 

### palette.py

Downloadable file which will create our color palettes for our program

If I can't figure that out, just rewatch the lecture after a certain point where he is demonstrating creating the color palettes
