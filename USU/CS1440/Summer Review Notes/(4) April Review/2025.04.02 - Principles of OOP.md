Difference between a Class and a Module
- A Class is a distinct datatype, which associates pieces of data (attributes) with methods
- A Module is a `.py` file, which can contain variables, functions, and classes, and can either be run as a program or imported
- `from [module] import [class]`

# Designing Classes
A good class has these following distinctions
0. Has a meaningful and cohesive purpose
1. Its name accurately and concisely represents a typical instance of the class
2. Its attributes are closely related to its purpose
3. Its methods rely primarily on its own attributes for computations

Think about what purpose the class will have. If it has too many responsibilities, consider splitting it up. Give the class a descriptive but soncise name. Try to recognize the types of attributes or methods that should be available to all instances of the class.

You can 'find' classes that should exist in a program by looking for keywords or nouns in a project's specification, or by grouping features and logic. 

# Principles of OOP
---
The four principles are:
0. Encapsulation
1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

Encapsulation
- Organizing related code together into one package
- Modularity
- "Good fences make good neighbours"
- This basically all means that you should try and keep external details separate from internal details. In Satisfactory, creating and using the modules in the blueprint creator was very similar to this because when it would come to actually using the modules, it didn't really matter exactly which recipes were used or what the internal structure of the blueprint was. Having that blueprint serve one specific purpose, and only really needing to know things like how many and what type of materials were needed, the footprint, or what it spat back out, were external details.

# External vs Internal details

External details in OOP
- The name of the class
- What parameters are required by the intializer
- What methods the class defines, and what parameters they take
- What types of data those methods return
- Which data attributes may be accessed, and their types

Internal details in OOP
- The algorithm used to create a new instance
- Which other objects this object makes upon creation
- Any loops, variable names, or temporary variables that are used in methods
- Names and signatures of the internal methods used by external methods

External details in Satisfactory
- What item is produced
- Which items are required for input
- The construction cost of the blueprint, how much power it uses, or the footprint
- Which orientation is used to daisy chain multiple blueprints together

Internal details in Satisfactory
- Which recipes are used by each machine
- How the machines are laid out
- The speed and position of each conveyor belt inside the blueprint
- Where the power lines are placed
- Any items that are created inside the blueprint to be used by other machines inside the same blueprint
