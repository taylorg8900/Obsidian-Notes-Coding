The four principles are:
0. Encapsulation
1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
# Abstraction
Good software is easy to understand and not needlessly complicated.

What is abstraction?
- Presenting only the essential qualities that matter, and de-emphasizing non essential details
- Reducing the complexity of a concept so it is easier to understand

# Inheritance
The principle of **Don't repeat yourself**

When you have some classes with related functionality, Inheritance lets you keep your code in one place and avoids duplication. This is good for so many reasons, but fixing bugs and centralizing code are the main ones that I remember.

```python
from superclass import SuperClassName

class SubClassName(SuperClassName):
	# subclass code down here
```

You use `super()` in Python to access the parent class or it's methods
- Most common use of this is in the `__init__()` method
