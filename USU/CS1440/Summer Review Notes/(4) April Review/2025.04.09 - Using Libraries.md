Using software libraries was a big leap forward in the efficiency of writing programs in the past, because each language could implement algorithms to be used. A good example would be merge sort, which is super efficient. If you had to write sorting algorithms from scratch, you probably wouldn't do as well. There are lots of libraries with functionality that basically just save you time when you use them in projects, and there are two that we will use on the last project for the class.

### Using `pathlib.Path` to find the stem of a path

If you wanted to find the file name without an extension of some path, you could create a custom algorithm that does the following:
1. Split the path into its directory and file name components
2. Remove the extension from the file name

```python
# this will fail on some computers since we aren't capable of handling backslashes
def path_to_stem(path):
	filename = path.split("/")[-1]
	return filename[:filename.rfind(".")]
```

Since using a custom function isn't really worth it, we instead do this
```python
from pathlib import Path
stem = Path("../data/8-points.frac").stem
print("Unix-style filename->stem =", stem)
stem = Path(r"../data/8-points.frac").stem
print("Windows-style filename->stem =", stem)
```

### Pip

Stands for ''Python install package"

We will use this to create our dynamic color palette for the project, since someone already wrote code to generate an array of colors that is as long as we want it to be

Installing the `colour` module
- `python -m pip install --user colour`

In pycharm when we accidentally import modules, it will run pip and go get them without you noticing

Since some modules import other libraries, when you pip install something you might get like 20 libraries installed
