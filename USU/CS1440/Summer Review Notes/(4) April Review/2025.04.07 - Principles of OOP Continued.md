The four principles are:
0. Encapsulation
1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
# Inheritance Continued
Inheritance lets you reuse code without needing to copy and paste it, and you are essentially letting the computer do the copy and pasting for you. Computers are perfect for repeating tedious tasks accurately, so let it just do it instead.

Inheritance has a big advantage over just using modules (like in Satisfactory), in that you can definitely make a program with only modules, but it will require some duplicated code or be more convoluted than if you just used inheritance.

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or function in their own way. This concept allows for methods to be used interchangeably, while still behaving differently based on the type of the object calling them.

# Abstract Classes
Cannot be instantiated into an object. Only used as a structure to inherit from, to make sure that subclasses have common functionality
- An abstract class may provide implementations for some of its methods
- A **pure** abstract class provides no implementation for any of its methods

In python, the language doesn't have compile time checks to make sure that an abstract class can't be instantiated. Here's how you can do this by taking advantage of method overriding in any subclasses

```python
class Sequence:
	def __init__(self, start=0):
		if type(self) == Sequence:
			raise NotImplementedError("Sequence is an abstract class. Use it as the base for your custom subclass")
		self._start = start
	
	def value(self):
		raise NotImplementedError("value() must be overriden in the subclass")
```
