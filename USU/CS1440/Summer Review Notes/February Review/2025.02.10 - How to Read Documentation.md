[How to Read Documentation article](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/duckiecorp/sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes/-/blob/master/How_to_Read_Documentation.md)

This lecture is about how to write good documentation for our project in the SDP (it's really more about what NOT to do), and to get us thinking about how to structure it and also approach reading it, not just for our projects but when we are doing things on our own in the future. Then he finishes the Plublequark text tool.
