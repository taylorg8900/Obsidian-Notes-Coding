This lecture is about how we should let the user give us the file to open, and the program shouldn't be responsible for whatever the input is. Let it crash if the user is being dumb! Stuff at the beginning of the lecture is just answering questions about the project. There is not a lot of content today really.

### Absolute and Relative paths

An absolute path lets a process specify a file literally anywhere on a computer regardless of the current working directory

A relative path is incomplete, and is combined with the current working directory to create the absolute path
- Convenience for user
- Automatically converted to an absolute path by the OS

### sys.argv

List of strings
- Element 0 is always the name of the command, aka the name of the python program
