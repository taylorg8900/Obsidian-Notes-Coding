You can create your own Exceptions by extending the `Exception` class

Exception Pros
 - Throwing exceptions is the only clean way to report an error when intializing an object, since that doesn't use return statements
 - Exceptions are often user defined types that carry much more information than normal error codes

Exception Cons
- Exceptions are usually pretty expensive, and can easily lead to resource leaks
- Exceptions break code structure by introducing multiple exit points and make it less readable
