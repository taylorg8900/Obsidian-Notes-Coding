I am going to keep all of my notes on Git in another area, but for today this is what he talks about
- Merge conflicts
- `git reflog`, which I don't even remember
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1`, which undoes the most recent commit
- `git revert -n OBJECT`
	- Creates and adds to the staging area a commit which is the inverse of `OBJECT` 
	- The `-n` flag avoids putting you into Vim, which would happen because `git revert` automatically commits
- `git blame -- FILENAME`
	- Shows you whoever modified the lines in `FILENAME` and when it happened
- `git bisect`
	- You need three things to properly use this
		1. A commit where the code works properly
		2. A commit which exhibits the bug
		3. A test that detects the bug (Erik used shell scripts and a `./configure` file for the example in class)
