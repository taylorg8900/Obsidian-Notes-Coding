| Test Case              | Inputs, conditions, and expected outputs of a piece of software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Test Suite             | A collection of test cases, related to a function or feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Manual Testing         | Human testers run through a test suite looking for unexpected behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ad Hoc Testing         | Informal, undocumented or unplanned software testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Automated Testing      | The test suite is a program which can detect unexpected behaviors, and may be run by a computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Unit Testing           | Fine-grained test cases designed to exercise the fundamental units of your program;  <br>most often this means testing individual functions/methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Integration Testing    | Testing two or more parts of a system together with a focus on detecting unexpected behavior in the interactions between the parts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| System Testing         | Testing the entire software system as a whole - at the opposite end of the granularity spectrum from Unit Testing.  <br>The most integrated of tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Non-Functional Testing | Testing Tests with a focus on the non-functional aspects of a system (did the system become slower, less usable, stable, or secure?),  <br>rather than on the measurable functionality that a Unit Test would cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Regression Testing     | Ensuring that a new software change hasn't created new problems or re-introduced old problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Smoke Testing          | (also known as Sanity Testing  <br>A quick, cursory test to make sure that the important aspects of a system are stable, and that the system may be subjected to more thorough testing.  <br>(e.g. did the build succeed without errors, does the program even launch, did that fix work or make things seriously worse, etc.)  <br>Some sources make a distinction between "smoke testing" and "sanity testing", at DuckieCorp these are interchangeable terms for quick, informal tests. |

# Failures, Faults, and Errors

Failure: Software behavior that is not expected, a programs operation is different than what it is required to do

Fault: A software defect that causes a failure to occur

Error: A bug. Unexpected behavior. A problem in the code, design, or requirements of the program

# Dictionaries
---
Creating
- Can be created with `dict()` constructor, or with the `{}` braces

Accessing values
- Immutable objects can be used as keys, such as strings, tuples, numbers
- `dictionary['key']` returns whichever value is associated

Adding things
- Can add by assigning directly to a key
- `dictionary['added_key'] = 'added_value'`

Operations
- `in` keyword will tell you if the key exists in the dictionary
- `del` keyword will let you remove a key value pair
	- `del dictionary['key']`
