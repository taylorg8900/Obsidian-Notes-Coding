`git help glossary` to view Git jargon

# Git Terms
---
Commit
- A single point in the Git history of a project
- Can also be the action of storing a new state of the project in the Git history

Head
- The currently checkout out commit

Working Tree
- Files and directories that are currently check out

Object name or SHA-1 ID
- A commit's 40 character long string is hexadecimal digits that identify it

# Git log
---
Displays the commit history from the current commit, back to the very first one

Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- `j` or `Down Arrow` to scroll down
- `k` or `Up Arrow` to scroll up
- `Space` to scroll down an entire screen
- `g` to jump to top
- `G` to jump to bottom
- `/[SEARCH TERM]` to find matches
	- `n` jumps to next match
	- `N` jumps to previous match
- `q` to quit
- `h` to open help page

Various flags/options for use
- `git log --stat` displays a brief summary of affected files and changes
- `git log --patch` displays a diff describing that commit
- `git log OBJECT` shows `git log` from whichever `OBJECT` you pass in
- `git log :/text` finds the youngest commit that has `text` inside of it's commit message

# Git diff
---
Shows the differences in each changed file since the last commit, which `git status` can't do 

Various flags/options
- `git diff -- FILE ...` displays changes in that file (or files)
- `git diff --cached` or `git diff --staged` is git diff, but for when your files are in the staging area between `git add` and `git commit`
- `git diff OBJECT` shows changes between `OBJECT` and `HEAD`, basically what would need to change to make it like `HEAD`
- `git diff OBJECT -- FILE ...` shows changes needed for a specific file in a specific commit to turn into how it is in `HEAD`

# Discarding Uncommitted Changes
---
Examples of using `git restore`
- `git restore README.md` will throw away changes to `README.md` since the last commit
- `git restore .` will throw away changes in the current directory
- `git restore :/` will throw away changes for the _entire_ repository
- `git restore --staged FILENAME ...` takes `FILENAME` out of the staging area

Using the old version of `git restore`
- Git restore is new, and the old way that you had to do it was like this:
- `git checkout -- FILE ...` 

# Git stash
---
This is basically the same as a regular commit, but the recording of the working directory is not kept inside the git history. It's like a little buffer where you can discard changes, but keep them around for later.

Commands
- `git stash` 
	- Stash the changes in the working tree, and restore it to the `HEAD` state.
	- You can make as many of these as you want, and they are kept in a stack in the order you make them
- `git stash list` lists the stack of stashed changes
- `git stash show` displays the names of files changed and number of lines changed by the top-most stash in the stack
- `git stash pop` apply the changes in the stashes top most entry to the working tree and discard the stash object
- `git stash apply` applies the changes in the stashes top most entry, but does not discard the stash object
- `git stash drop` discards the most recent stash entry

# Tagging commits
---
A convenient way of creating or referring to commits by assigning them a name that only exists on your local machine unless you explicitly push it to the server.

Commands and flags
- `git tag` lists existing tags
- `git tag TAGNAME` gives `TAGNAME` to the current commit (which is `HEAD`)
	- `TAGNAME` can only refer to one commit, but a commit can have multiple tags
- `git tag TAGNAME OBJECT` applies `TAGNAME` to whichever commit is identified by `OBJECT`
- `git tag -d TAGNAME` removes a tag from a commit
- `git push REMOTE TAGNAME` is required for pushing tags to a remote repository
- `git push REMOTE --tags` pushes all defined tags to `REMOTE`
- `git push --delete REMOTE TAGNAME` removes  `TAGNAME` from the `REMOTE` repository
