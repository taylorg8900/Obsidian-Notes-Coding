# Basic Operations

Open
- Takes a file's name as a string and returns a file object
- `f = open(FILENAME)`

Read
- You can read any amount of data in a file, up to how much it contains
- `f.read(10)` gives you ten bytes
- `f.read()` or `f.read(-1)` gives you the whole file
- `.readline()` gives you one line

Write
- Not important for this class, so not taking notes on it

Close
- Closes the file, obvious why you want to do this and keep memory from leaking

Basic example
```python
f = open("README.md")
for line in f:
	print(line, end='')
f.close()
```

### Classic Unix text-processing tools

| Tool  | Description                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| cat   | Concatenate files and print on the standard output |
| tac   | Concatenate and print files in reverse             |
| nl    | Number lines of files                              |
| cut   | Remove sections from each line of files            |
| paste | Merge lines of files                               |
| grep  | Print lines of files matching a pattern            |
| head  | Output the first part of files                     |
| tail  | Output the last part of files                      |
| sort  | Sort lines of text files                           |
| wc    | Print newline, word, and byte counts of text files |

The rest of the lecture is going over strategy for the project, like which order to approach the tools and modeling the SDP so we don't suck at creating one
