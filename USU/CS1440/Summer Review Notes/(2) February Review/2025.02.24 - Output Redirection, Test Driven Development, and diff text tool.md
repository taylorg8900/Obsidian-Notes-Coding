# TDD (Test driven development)
---
An approach to software development where you design tests before writing code
0. Pick a function that the code should perform
1. Write a test that would verify if the function works properly
2. Write the code to perform the function, creating the simplest piece of code that can do this
3. Add any new tests that occur to you while writing the code
4. Run the new test(s) with any previous tests, and fix bugs until they all pass

Why do this?
- It helps you catch bugs early since your code is testable early on
- When a test starts to fail, you can identify which changes could have caused the new behavior
- It keeps you focused on solving a narrow problem at a time, and not getting scope creep

# Output Redirection
---
The shell can take output produced by a command line program and redirect it into files instead of the screen

Terminology
- **Standard Input** (`STDIN`)
	- The default source of a command line program's input, usually comes from the keyboard
- **Standard Output**  (`STDOUT`)
	- Default destination of a command line program's output, which is the terminal's screen
- **Standard Error** (`STDERR`)
	- Default destination of error messages, which is also the terminal screen

You redirect standard output into a *new* file with `>`

You append standard output into an *existing* file with `>>`

`command [argument ..] | tee output.txt` lets you see the output, and at the same time redirect it to a file `output.txt`

# Diff text tool
---
`$ diff [-u] [-Z] [--color=always] FILE0 FILE1` is an example we can dissect really quick
- `diff` shows us how to chnage `FILE0` into `FILE1`
- `-u` makes `diff` look like how `git diff` does, by using 'unified format'
- `-Z` makes it disregard EOL characters (since windows uses carriage return, this is very useful)
- `[--color=always]` color codes the output the same was as `git diff`
