This lecture talks more about sys.argv, and the difference between running programs in the CLI and Pycharm. He then goes into how to run the command line arguments withing Pycharm, which I remember not thinking was important to know. And then he ends the lecture with the Plumblequark Text Tools. He is just trying to get us familiar with creating our own text tools and using them from the CLI, so there isn't anything for me to really take notes on.
