This folder and any subfolders or notes are here because I wanted to go over all of the notes for the spring semester again, a few months after having completed the class. I also want to have a super clean place for notes since I can see myself coming back here frequently in the future and possibly even in my future career. I feel like the notes I took in class for the first half of the semester were kind of sloppy, and I wasn't taking advantage of markdown formatting.
