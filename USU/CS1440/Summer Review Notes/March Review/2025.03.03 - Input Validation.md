# Input Validation
---
Input validation is the process of ensuring that data entered into a program meets certain criteria, which you need for the integrity, accuracy, and security of the system

Types of input validation
- **Type Checking**: Checking that it is a certain type (integer, string, etc)
- **Range Checking**: Checking that it is within a specific numerical range 
- **Pattern Matching**: Using tools like regex to validate the format, like email addresses or phone numbers

Levels of input validation
- **Syntactic**: Validate the format
	- Asking how long it should be, which characters are ok to be included, which patterns of orders are allowed
- **Semantic**: Validating the details of the input
	- For example, the first digit of an area code can *never* be a `0` or `1`

Never use this shit EVER, because malicious lines of text can just run in the program and fuck everything up
