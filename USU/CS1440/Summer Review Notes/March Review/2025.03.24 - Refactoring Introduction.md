This lecture is when project 4.0 (the Fractal Visualizer) was introduced, which was all about refactoring the code so it doesn't make your head fucking explode when you read it or work in the future to add functionality to it

My biggest takeaways after having already completed this project:
- Make a LOT of small and frequent git commits, and make extensive use of branches as well
- Create unit tests, and make use of them as liberally as possible
- Use the REPL to understand why things don't work and what they should look like, without having to modify the original code immediately
