This lecture is Erik talking about what a Class even is as a concept in programming

Honestly I already know everything in here, and it wouldn't be a good use of time to go over concepts that are in my opinion very basic. Here is a [link to the class notes](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/duckiecorp/sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes/-/blob/master/Module5/Lec32-Mon_Mar_31/README.md) if I ever want to read or skim them again.
