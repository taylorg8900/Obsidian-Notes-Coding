This lecture is Erik talking about what a Class even is as a concept in programming
- Has attributes, methods
- Can be made of other objects (composition), inherit from them
- etc

Honestly I already know everything in here, and it wouldn't be a good use of time to go over concepts that are in my opinion very basic. Here is a [link to the class notes](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/duckiecorp/sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes/-/blob/master/Module5/Lec32-Mon_Mar_31/README.md) if I ever want to read or skim them again.

Something useful would be the following

Designing Software Classes
- Use classification to understand what problem the class needs to solve, and set boundaries around what is should be capable of
- Organize and manage classes so that each one has a meaningful and *singular* purpose
	- Having a class with multiple responsibilites goes against encapsulation
- Make it so that methods rely primarily on the attributes of the class itself
