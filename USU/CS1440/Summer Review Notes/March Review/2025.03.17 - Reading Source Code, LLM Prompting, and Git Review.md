# [How to read source code](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/duckiecorp/sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes/-/blob/master/How_to_Read_Source_Code.md)
---
It sounds obvious, but reading other people's code is a really good way to improve because you'll see things you would not have considered otherwise. It's like if you were a fiction author, but never read any other fiction books then you would definitely suck at writing fiction

Some ways to learn how a software system works
- Reading documentation
	- Studying UML diagrams
	- Examing user manuals
	- Reading technical design documents
- Running software and experimenting with it
- Consulting more experienced programmers who have worked on it
- Reading source code
	- Reading the software change log
	- Skimming through the version control history

Challenges that you face when reading other people's code (copy and pasted)
1. Code is often written without any regard for a human who may have the misfortune of looking at it again in the future.
    - Thoughtlessly written code is downright hostile to the reader
2. Computer code is unlike any other type of writing that you've been trained in
    - It isn't structured like a reference work
    - It doesn't flow like prose
    - Nor is it elegant and full of feeling like poetry
    - There are many details to keep track of:
        - Variables (their scope, their values at each point in time)
        - Modules, classes, functions defined in the project and how they rely upon each other
3. The program may be written in a programming language that you are not familiar with, presenting you with two large tasks at once:
    1. Learning an unfamiliar system
    2. Learning a new programming language
4. The coding style may hinder your understanding
    - Every programmer develops their own personal style, and it is highly unlikely that you'll like their style
    - The authors employ idioms that you have not encountered before
    - Even if it's written in a language that you know, style differences can make it feel like an entirely new language
    - Poorly named variables, functions, classes are used throughout
    - Clumsy formatting slows you down
    - Distracting comments that are outdated, inaccurate, contradictory
    - Large chunks of commented out code
5. The program uses libraries that you've never even heard of...
    - ...or outdated versions that are drastically different from what you've used
6. You may be unsure of the purpose of the program
    - Your mental model of the system does not remotely match the code that is before you
    - Perhaps you can't figure out how to build & run the program to see how it works
7. You may not know where to start reading (where does the computer begin execution?)
    - The flow of the program jumps around a lot, especially across lots and lots of files
    - The code is disorganized (files/functions/classes are too long)
8. Lack of (up-to-date) documentation

## Tips for reading source code
---
Erik's person tips
1. Get the code into a version control system (such as Git) if it isn't already
    - If it is in version control, skim the messages for commits that affect the part of the program I'm interested in. Look for important events:
        - What bugs have been fixed in the part of the program I'm working on?
        - What major changes/improvements have occurred?
2. Browse the program's code in an IDE
    - IDEs have powerful navigation and search capabilities
    - As much as I love Vim, sometimes I have to break down and use an IDE to take advantage of these tools, especially for a huge program
3. Identify the main entry point(s)
    - In some languages (typically the compiled ones), look for a function/method named `main()`
    - In dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, Perl and JavaScript you'll have to do your best to find files that aren't obviously filling the role of a library or "package"
4. `grep` the source code for keywords, error message strings, names of important functions and classes
    - If the program has a GUI, search for text that appears on buttons and controls that you are interested in, then look for the code that is run when you click on it
    - If the program has a CLI, search for the part of the program that parses the command line arguments, and find the code that handles interesting options
5. Run the program in the debugger
    - Step through the main function and learn how the program starts itself up
    - Set a breakpoint in a part of the program that you are interested in, and run the program, trying to trigger it
    - Inspect variables to learn what data is available at that point in the program
    - Read the call stack to learn how the program got there
6. Run the suite of tests
    - I prefer _integration tests_ to _unit tests_ for this purpose
        - I find that unit tests are too fine-grained to be helpful at the beginning when I'm still getting oriented
        - Once I have a good grasp on the overall system, unit tests help me understand the expectations of the specific area I will work in
7. Refactor the code and rewrite it in my own style
    - I don't do this with the intention of submitting it or even showing it to anybody else
    - By rewriting it in my own style, I force myself to really think deeply about it
    - By "fixing" portions that I don't like I come to understand why it was written the way it was
    - Once I understand it, I revert it back to its original form before doing my _real_ work
8. Change the program in some fun way to put your mental model to the test
    - If the program has a splash screen, disable it or make it say something different
    - Make a button pop up a new dialog box when clicked, instead of or in addition to its normal function
    - Add a new option to a menu, or add a new command-line option
    - Cause the program to print a new message to prove that line of code was reached
    - When you are able to reliably make these changes work, you are well on your way to understanding how the whole program works
9. Take notes and draw diagrams
    - Make a UML class diagram of the important pieces
    - Keep track of important classes, functions, variables
10. Explain that the program does to your rubber ducky
    - Use your notes and diagrams to make your case
    - Make predictions about what should happen in certain situations, then test it!
11. Ask an AI Chatbot what the code does
    - This works best with short passages of code - presently, a Chatbot won't be able to understand an entire program (or even an entire file)
    - Paste the code into the prompt and ask questions like
        - "explain this program to me in simple terms"
        - "translate this program into pseudocode"
        - "what is the purpose of variable 'X'?"

You can approach reading the code in a couple different ways. The ones that Erik talks about are top down and bottom up
- Top down
	1. Find the main entry point
	2. Note which libraries are imported
	3. Note which data types and constants are defined
	4. Read through main function, and notice which variables are used and which functions are called
	5. Repeat this for each sub function that is called
- Bottom up
	1. Find something that looks interesting, and skim over it until you kind of know what it does in the big picture
	2. Scan through functions and methods looking for 'leaf nodes' which don't call any other functions
	3. Look for higher level functions which call the lower level functions
	4. Keep going this until you know how all of the pieces fit together

Okay so I think LLMs are kind of stupid so I won't take notes on this, but if I ever need them [here they are](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/duckiecorp/sp25-cs1440-lecturenotes/-/tree/master/Module4/Lec26-Mon_Mar_17?ref_type=heads)
