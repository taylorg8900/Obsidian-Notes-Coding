- Need to rewrite this since the behavior of the program won't be told to the user through `usage` or something like that
- Include things like if arguments are case insensitive

I like this layout

# Design Patterns
---
Before we talk about whatever design patterns are, we need to understand when and why we reuse code
1) Cutting and pasting blocks of code
	- Quick, easy, but can be difficult to adapt to specific problem and will spread bugs if there are any
2) Abstract Data Types
	- A data type defined by the behaviors it enables, or which methods it provides
	- More of an idea than a block of code you are just shoving into your program
3) Libraries
	- Vast collection of reusable code
	- Standard libraries that are a part of modern programming languages are readily available
	- Can be difficult to integrate sometimes, and you can lose some flexibility in your solution
4) Algorithms
	- Solves a specific problem
	- An idea that is expressed as pseudocode, or a formula
5) Design Patterns
	- Solves a general problem
	- An idea that might not easily express as pseudocode
	- Pattern that shows up constantly in different programs (many problems are the same thing in the end)
	- Is not a ready-made solution, and you need judgement to decide the right time and place to apply it

# The Strategy Pattern
- Enables your system or a user to select an algorithm or behavior at runtime
- The programmer could hardcode one algorithm into a program, but what if you want to select a different one?
- Uses inheritance to solve this problem

The example for using the Strategy Pattern in the notes is the following:
- Imagine you had a program that could use the following three sorting algorithms to sort something. You can define a default behavior, but sometimes it is better to use one specific sorting algorithm over another
	- Bubble sort 
	- Quick sort
	- Merge sort
- You could have one big if/elif chain that will see if the user inputs a specific command line argument like we have done for projects such as the text tools project and the fractal project

The problem we have is that we need to figure out which object we are creating based on the input, so far we have used if/elif chains to do this

# The Factory Method Pattern

Basically putting whatever if/elif chain that we use to create objects somewhere else, so that it is super easy to reduce the if/elif chains that we need 

Instead of having multiple if/elif chains for each possible amount of command line arguments, we just use default arguments in a function named `sequenceFactory` and keep the skeleton

Basically doing this
```
The structure of a sloppy main file would look like this:
if number of argv
	if this
	elif this
	elif this
	elif this
elif number of argv
	if this 
	elif this
	elif this
	elif this
elif number of argv
	if this
	elif this
	elif this
	elif this

We can restructure this so that we keep the basic if/elif chain, but abstract the repeated 4 length block inside each one to some function in another file so it becomes much shorter and less copy-pasty
```

Where the 'Factory Method' code looks like:
```python
from fib import Fib
from fizzbuzz import FizzBuzz
from pell import Pell
from fogbag import FogBag
from nonsquare import NonSquare

def sequenceFactory(seqtype='fib', start=0, end=101):
    if seqtype.lower() == 'fib':
        return Fib(start, end)
    elif seqtype.lower() == 'fizzbuzz':
        return FizzBuzz(start, end)
    elif seqtype.lower() == 'fogbag':
        return FogBag(start, end)
    elif seqtype.lower() == 'pell':
        return Pell(start, end)
    elif seqtype.lower() == 'nonsquare':
        return NonSquare(start, end)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(f"This factory cannot instantiate a '{seqtype}' object")
```

Using the sequenceFactory function in main:
```python
import sys
from factory import sequenceFactory
def usage():
    print(f"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} fib|fizzbuzz|fogbag|pell|nonsquare [[START] END]")
if len(sys.argv) >= 4:
    seq = sequenceFactory(sys.argv[1], start=int(sys.argv[2]), end=int(sys.argv[3]))
elif len(sys.argv) == 3:
    seq = sequenceFactory(sys.argv[1], end=int(sys.argv[2]))
elif len(sys.argv) == 2:
    seq = sequenceFactory(sys.argv[1])
else:
    seq = sequenceFactory()
# at this point, what is the type of seq?
# does it even matter?
print(f"The type of seq is {type(seq)}")
seq.run()
```

We have basically done the following to the above code block
```
if number of argv      <- Kept by the Factory pattern
	if this                <- Kept by the Strategy pattern
	elif this              <- Kept by the Strategy pattern
	elif this              <- Kept by the Strategy pattern
	elif this              <- Kept by the Strategy pattern
elif number of argv    <- Kept by the Factory pattern
	if this 
	elif this
	elif this
	elif this
elif number of argv    <- Kept by the Factory pattern
	if this
	elif this
	elif this
	elif this

The duplicated blocks of code are gone now, and since the if/elif chains are separate, we can change them independently of each other in the future
