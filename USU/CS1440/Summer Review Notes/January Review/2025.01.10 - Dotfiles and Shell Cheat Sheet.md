# Dotfiles
These are files that begin with a `.`, such as `.gitignore`. They are usually hidden from file listings when you use `ls`, but can still be seen when you use `ls -a`
- Because they are hidden like this, they began to get used as configuration files

As configuration files
- `~/.bashrc` is a configuration file, and the `rc` stands for run commands
	- Some people regard `rc` to mean resource, or resource files
- Any commands that you want to run upon opening a new terminal can be put in here
