# Markdown Markup Language
He introduces this here because it is what he uses in lecture notes, and using it in our projects while working on the Software Development Plan will make it more readable

### Section Formatting
formatting for sections of code
- Headers
	- Preface a line of text with between 1-6 '#' signs, more '#' = smaller text
- Paragraphs
	- separate paragraphs with a blank line 
	- indentation is not preserved
- BlockQuotes
	- add a > in front of a paragraph
	- add 2 >> to make a nested blockquote
	- add blank lines before and after blockquote sections
- Pre-formatted code blocks
	- preserves indentation and spacing exactly
	- made by indenting a block of text by four spaces, or fencing an entire block of text with triple back ticks or triple tildes
- Syntax highlighting
	- used in Gitlab, and maybe GitHub
	- create a pre-formatted code block using fencing, and put the name of the programming language after the opening fence
- Tables
	- a giant pain in the ass to make, can use this link to create one easily tho: [link](https://stevecat.net/table-magic/)
	- can create them in Obsidian with right click -> insert, has same formatting as normal though you can't mess with it
- Lists
	- bulleted lists are prefixed with characters such as `-`, `+`, `*` 
	- numbered lists are prefixed with something like `1.` or `439.`, needs a period after the number
	- Task lists are created when the first item after the list marker is a pair of square brackets containing a space, x, or tilde
		- not every md system recognizes them, but Gitlab does
		- it appears obsidian also does task lists
### Smaller Formatting
formatting for words, or smaller parts of the document
- Bold text
	- surround with two asterisks: \*\*example\*\* -> **example**
	- can use with italicize like this: \*\*\*example\*\*\* -> ***example***
- Strike through
	- surround with two tildes: \~\~example\~\~ -> ~~example~~
- Italicize
	- surround with single asterisks: \*example\* -> *example* 
	- can also surround with single underlines: \_example\_ -> _example_ 
- Code span
	- surround with 1 back tick: \`example\` -> `example`
- Hyperlinks
	- format is `[]()`, with link in the square brackets and the web address in the parentheses
- Reference Style Links
	- the links that can be stored in two different places, used at bottom of websites as footnotes for things like citations
	1) first part, similar to a normal hyperlink in it's usage, looks like: `[a strange link][1]`
	2) second part, at the bottom of the page or something, looks like: `[1]: https://.....`
		- the '1' will be smaller also
- Images
	- format is `![]()` 
	- alt-text goes in the square brackets, which is shown when the image cant be loaded or displayed
	- address of image goes in the parentheses
	- in parentheses, can write a title for the image as a quoted string
- Horizontal rules
	- add 3 dashes or more under a header, to make a long line that looks very fancy

# Pseudocode
---
turning whats into hows
- psuedocode = 'false code' or 'imitation code'
- lets you essentially write code that can be interpreted into any language in the future
- "**hardest part of programming**", but once it is over making the actual program is super easy
- combine with "stepwise refinement" from cs1410 to be a black belt pseudocode master

prototyping
- what i do which isn't super effective for large programs
- jumping right into making something without a real plan, or understanding what future pieces you will need or how they fit together

# Software Development Plans
---
used to **save time**
0) requirements analysis
1) design
2) implementation
3) testing and debugging
4) deployment
5) maintenence

The first two steps take up 50% of the time on a project, as that is getting a good idea of what the structure will look like; the rest of it should be relatively easy once you have a view of the bigger picture and a framework from which to work (including pseudocode)

# Sprint Signatures
---
Called 'sprint' signatures, because a time period of two weeks in the industry is called a sprint, and it's the amount of time we have to work on projects

Keep a daily, summarized log of the entire day's main activites along with how much time you spent
- this helps you keep track of what you are struggling on, when you hit a wall, or to hold yourself accountable for procrastinating
