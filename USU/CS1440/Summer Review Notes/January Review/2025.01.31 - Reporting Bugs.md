He spends a lot of this lecture talking about not so useful things
- BSidesSLC
- Withdrawing from the class if you need
- Reporting bugs to him in emails, and that screenshots are not effective for this
- Indexing into Strings, or using for loops on strings

The only useful thing I have is from my notes in class, which contains the following

## Modifying Strings
Strings are like Tuples, meaning they are immutable
- they are also like lists in that you access parts of them the same way as a list
	- `string[0] = ...`
	- `string[-1]` is how you access the last element in python the 'pythonic way'

changing a specific element of the string
- since strings are not mutable, we can't directly assign a piece of it to something
	- `s[-1] = 'a'` does not work
	- `s = s[0:-1] + 'a'` does work, since we are copying the original and adding to it

# File Operations
files in python behave somewhat like lists of strings  
four basic operations that all programming languages let you do to files
- open
- read
- write
- close

Sentinel value
- empty string with read(), marks the end of the file
