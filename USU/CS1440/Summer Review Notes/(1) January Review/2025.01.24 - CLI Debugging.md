# Call Stack
I already know what this is, but the point of talking about it here is that the debugger lets you visualize it and you can navigate through it to see what is going on and how we got to our current point

# CLI debugger
Why would we use this over the one in Pycharm?
- If we are in the real world on someone else's computer and they somehow don't have pycharm or something, we will always have access to this if their program is written in Python

Make sure to have two windows open if using this!
- One where you have the source code open
- Another where you can control the debugger

Launching the debugger
- Add `-m pdb` to the command between `python` and the name of your file
	- `python -m pdb main.py`

### Command list
---
These are the ones that Erik uses whenever he has to debug our code. Also, there are a lot of random parentheses in the notes so I'm not sure if they are typos. If I ever use this in the future, it might be a little inaccurate. I am going to just copy and past to preserve the syntax.
