This lecture was an introduction to the course, Erik as a professor, and what the objectives are for us to take away while working through material. There isn't a whole lot of 'important things' in here, but I will write down the things that are most relevant, now that I am looking back.

Erik spent his career
- Reading horrible documentation
- Testing old code written by himself and other people
- Finding and fixing bugs
- Reviewing code written by his team

Code is structured (abstracted) in this way
- Well written code is organized into layers that keep big ideas together and separate from smaller ideas
- Abstract is big picture, and concrete is small details, and code is layered to keep a distinction between the two and everything along the spectrum
- `main()` should read like a table of contents, like a to do list composed of bigger 'ideas' which are abstracted away and handled by smaller functions, which can call even smaller functions

Virtues of a great programmer
1. Laziness (Finding the most efficient way of doing something)
2. Impatience (Your time is more important than the computer's)
3. Hubris (I can do this better)
4. Curiosity (The desire to understand how things really work)
