What you need before debugging
1. A failure (unexpected behavior)
2. An error (a coding mistake that causes unexpected behavior)

There really isn't a lot of useful information in this lecture, and in my first notes I literally didn't write down anything at all. He mentions test cases, and that in the real world the people who write the code shouldn't be the same people who write test cases. He mentions using print statements to catch bugs, and using rubber duck debugging. Pretty sure nothing important happened here.
