What is the REPL?
- An interactive environment for Python where you can experiment with the language one line at a time
- If there is an expression inside of the line you feed it, it will automatically print the result for you to view

Why is it called the REPL?
0. Read a line of code as a string
1. Evaluate the string as an instruction
2. Print the result 
3. Loop to the top and await a new line

How to exit
- `exit()` or `^D`

Launching the REPL
0. Launch it without a program
	- Simply type `python` or `python3` with no arguments
	- The terminal should display a `>>>` prompt
	- Only Python's built in variables, functions, and classes are available this way
1. Launch with a program
	- If the program is `main.py`, it would look like `python -i main.py`
	- All global variables, functions, and classes in `main.py` are accessible along with Python's built ins

What can you do in the REPL?
- Run functions that are built in to the language
- Run functions or view variables that are defined in a program that is launched with the REPL
- Define new functions, variables, and classes to experiment with
- Paste pieces of code from other files to see what they do

# Important REPL functions

`help()` : Display Python documentation without the internet
- Calling it with no arguments
	1. The prompt will change from `>>>` to `help>`
	2. Enter the name of a topic to read about it
	    - High-level topics include `modules`, `keywords`, `symbols`, and `topics`.
	    - Enter `topics` to be shown a list of topics in UPPERCASE; to read about one of these topics, refer to it in UPPERCASE to avoid ambiguity
	3. You may also give the name of a _class_ or _module_
	4. Leave the help system and return to Python's `>>>` prompt by typing `"quit"`.
- Calling it with one argument
	- For example, saying `help(str)` brings up the documentation for the string class in Python
	- When the argument is a function, it's signature is displayed (custom documentation in programs witht he three double quotes)

`dir():` List attributes and methods of an object
- Calling it with no arguments
	- Will return the names in the current scope
	- Reveals which names are usable in the REPL
- Calling with one argument
	- Returns a list of names of members and methods of an object

`type()` : Reveal the type of a value
- The only thing that I can say here is that since Python is a dynamic language and doesn't have type declaration, this will let you find out if something is a bool, string, float, etc
