# input validation
want to validate what user gives you before you use their data
- want to provide a good error message for them
- prevent junk data from being put it and held onto by program

types of input validation
1. type checking - make sure it is correct data type
2. range checking - data falls within a certain range
3. pattern matching - checking format, like URLs, phone numbers, email, etc 

'broad levels' of input validation
- syntactic - validate the format or shape of input
	- checking things like 'cannot contain these characters', length, etc
- semantic
	- checking that data makes sense, like specific combinations of characters or something
- i guess syntactic is like trimming the data, then semantic is looking for finer details

# eval()
why is it bad?
- can do anything, which means that whatever is passed into it can do pretty much anything like run functions, crash the program, install malware, injection attacks
- example in class is hiding an import statement and running a shell script in the python program
- many other examples like deleting entire directories when a csv file gets ran in a program 

what else can it do
- is flexible, can evaluate what is given and spit out ints, floating point numbers, strings, etc

# exec()
worse than eval

can run multiple lines of code, multiple statements, use the import statement

point of the video is that you can never do enough testing
