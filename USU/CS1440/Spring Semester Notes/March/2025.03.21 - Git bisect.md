will apparently save a lot of work (maybe)

how to identify which commit is the one that introduced a bug
- go and launch your program from the last commit and go one by one until you find a version which doesn't have the bug (manual)
	- basically linear search
- what we need is a binary search instead, since commits are organized chronologically

binary search in git
- `git bisect start`
- `git bisect bad` or `git bisect good` if assuming that good commits come before bad ones
- `git bisect old` and `git bisect new` are different terms, but basically the same as 'good' and 'bad' 

important: make commits that only serve one purpose or solve one problem so that it is easier to track down problems in the future

also important: knowing how to use shell scripts to automate using git bisect to find the bug without having to manually do things

## comments

self-documenting code
- code with really descriptive variables or names or identifiers that make it so you don't need to put in comments as often, makes it way more readable
- if code was a hot dog, then the comments are like condiments (having too many is gross)
- let the code explain what is happening, and use comments to explain WHY you are doing it that way
