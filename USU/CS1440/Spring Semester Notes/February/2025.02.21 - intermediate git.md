 HEAD
 - currently checked out commit
 - analagous to current working directory for commits

objects
- the git commit, it's 'true name' is the sha-1 id
- can be referred to by the sha-1 key, a relative reference like HEAD, a branch name like master, main, etc, or the name of a tag

git log commands
- `git log --stat` shows a relative amount of changes between commits with a fancy graphic
- `git log --patch` displays a diff describing that commit
	- i think this is basically showing a window into the parts of the file that got changed, like gives you context by showing snippets of what got added/removed but not sure
- `git log OBJECT` like HEAD or something
	- shows all of the commits that the OBJECT descended from, to the start of the repo
	- probably useful with tags specifically to shorten down what you want to look for
- `git diff` 
	- shows difference between current state of repo and most recent commit, like `git status` but more detailed
	- `git diff -- FILE` to show changes in specific files
	- `git diff --cached` or `git diff --staged` can be used between adding and committing to see differences while it is still in the 'staging' area
	- `git diff OBJECT` to see differences between some commit and the HEAD
	- `git diff OBJECT -- FILE ...` to see changes between OBJECT and HEAD, but only for the listed files. for example running `git diff designed -- doc/Plan.md` will only show changes for doc/Plan.md from the HEAD and the commit with the 'designed' tag
- `git restore`
	- to restore all files in the **entire repo** do `git restore :/` 
	- saying `git restore .` only restores files in the current directory
	- `git restore --staged` 
		- for unstaging changes
		- `git restore --staged FILENAME`
- `git stash`
	- good to know about if you are working on something between two computers and you need to sync up the repos temporarily
	- `git stash show` shows what was changed in the stash
	- `git stash pop` takes it out of the stash and puts it back 
	- `git stash apply` does not remove stash from stack
	- `git stash drop` discards the most recent stash 

git log viewer shortcuts
- `/KEYWORD` to search for something like hitting ctrl f in a browser
	- `n` for next match, `N` for previous match
- `g` for top of log, `G` for bottom of log
- `h` to display help page, for seeing other commands
	- `q` to quit this
