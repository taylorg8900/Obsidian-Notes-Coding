notes before beginning 
- in pseudocode, include things for error messages. try to think of every possible way the program will go before making it


args in pycharm
- right click somewhere in the IDE and do `run ____` then go to run/ debug configurations, and change the script parameters, or maybe it is in edit configurations in the dropdown next to the green button 
- just use 'in' keyword, which is what i was thinking anyway so yeah pretty simple

flimbble dorf thing or whatever its called
-  use usage in main file, not inside modules i think if you do then it will cause circular imports 
	- actually dont do this
- keep things 'self-contained'
-  pop method to get rid of flags after seeing them
- args.pop(0) for example
