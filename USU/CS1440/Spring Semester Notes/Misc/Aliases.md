example of creating the 'cs1440' alias 
- `cd` to go into source folder or something i actually dont know what this is called
- type `nano /.bashrc` 
- at the bottom of the file type out `alias cs1440='cd c:/my_folders/coding/classes/cs1440'`
- exit and save
- type `source ~/.bashrc` to reload the shell without having to exit and reopen it, and alias works now

can also type `nano ~/.bashrc` to edit the file without navigating to that source folder thing
