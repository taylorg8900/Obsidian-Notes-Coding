,summary for today: introduction to the REPL, which you can use to test things in a no stakes environment and also find documentation for lots of things using 3 important REPL functions (see below). REPL is useful because you can experiment freely with it, find out why code isn't working how you expect, and find documentation to fix incompatability between 2 different versions of a language in jobs

how to use lecture notes
	just the stuff on gitlab ig
	search bar on left side also
	cloned them into documents/cs1440 for future reference
	can put all files in repo back to original state with git restore :/
REPL in python
	interactive environment
	lets you run a line at a time and see what it does / experiment and try out ideas 
	READ a line of code
	EVALUATE the string as instruction
	PRINT the result
	LOOP back and await a new line of code
	if you call individual functions in isolation using REPL its better for learning and understanding what they do
	useful if stealing code and seeing what specific sections do
	also useful for troubleshooting because it always tells you the current documentation for YOUR env, so you can see what is making things crash
using python REPL
	type 'python' in CLI
	'exit()' to exit
	you can also just type in things like 8\*8 on their own and it will evaluate and print out, not just using print()
3 important REPL functions
	help(): display python documentation
		#important if you create a 'literal string' right after defining a function in python, that becomes documentation, this is the thing where you have multiline comment using three double quotes
		'help(print)'
	dir(): list attributes and methods of an object
	type(): determine a value's type
		type(print) for example
		type(2222.2222) for example
