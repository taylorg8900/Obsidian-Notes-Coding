summary for today: today was actually pretty important for understanding what makes a good design of a database. There are 'normal forms' which a well designed database should adhere to, and if a particular table doesn't fit them, there are really easy ways to fix them so that it makes sense. 

summary cont.
First normal form: table matches DROP acronym (see below)
Second normal form: table doesn't include any partial dependencies
Third normal form: table doesn't include any transitive dependencies
fixes: usually take the determinant and it's functional dependency and separate into a new table

normalization
	'unintended consequences'
		delete anomalies
		update anomalies
		insert anomalies
	keeping themes separate
#term determination
	'the attribute (or attributes) we use as the starting point is called a #term determinant. The variable on the right side of the equation is called a #term functional dependency'
	example: (itemprice, quantity) ->
normalization terms
	determinant -> functional dependant
	key/non key
	1st normal form (DROP)
	2nd normal form (partial dependency)
	3rd normal form (transitive dependency)
DROP acronym
	D - one data type (char, str, numeric, etc)
	R - repeating group (basically only have one thing in each row, can't use mulitiple rows to add new information)
	O - one piece of information per cell
	P - must have primary key established
ATOMIC attribute
	an attribute that cannot be further subdivided
	example: last name is atomic, first name + last name together in a column isnt

2nd normal form
	need to be in 1st normal form first of all
	no partial dependencies
		if composite key, could potentially violate second normal form
		how to fix?
			which is determinant?
			determinant becomes new primary key of new table
			dependancy gets dragged with it into new table
			make determinant a foreign key of the original table
			new table is actually parent table btw
				this is because the relationship is stored in new table only one time, and in original table was stored N times, which is way more error prone
	each column must depend on the whole key
3rd normal form
	must be in second normal form
	no transitive dependencies
		no column can have any dependency on any other non-key column
		how to fix? 
			same as 2nd normal form fix, where you decide what the primary key is and put it in it's own table with the functional dependency in there too and keep it as a foreign key in the original table 
	#important helps maintain referential integrity
foreign key
	italicized in this class when writing it out
normalization main rule
	all determinants are candidate keys!
