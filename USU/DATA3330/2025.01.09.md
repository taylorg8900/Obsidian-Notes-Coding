summary of today: going over / reviewing basic parts of SQL early and refreshing students memory of a lot of terms and ideas so that learning new ones in a couple weeks will be easier. The 'gameshow' game in class. Terms are tables, rows/columns/cells, primary keys, non keys, foreign keys, composite keys, surrogate keys, NULL value, and metadata. There was an emphasis on referential integrity, where a foreign key must exist before creating stuff, which will also get covered more later.

tldr: lot of terms, gameshow, referential integrity


follow up on penny metaphor
	SQL is like that where people remember the gist but not the details
to do
	read chapter 3 from whatever textbook
	the textbook is i think t-sql fundamentals or something
class design approach
	relating what students already know to new content to increase retention
table
	ONE theme per table
	ONE piece of information per cell
		ONE studentID, ONE last name, ONE locker
		instead of having one name, have one first name and one last name
	ONE row per record (called repeating groups)
	ONE datatype per column
SQL DDL
	the thing that looks like CREATE TABLE with the data types for each column
rows, columns and cells
	Row (**Record** or Tuple) a single entry in a table
		also called a record
	Column (**Field** or Attribute): a vertical entry in a database that describes a specific property or characteristic of the data being stored in the table
	Cell: Intersection of a colum and a row
primary key + non key
	a #term primary key is a column that uniquely identifies a row
	ideally: numeric, non repeating, no meaning
	automatically creates a #term clustered index
		a clustered index determines how data is physically sorted and stored in the order of the primary key
		only one clustered index is allowed per table
		clustered indexes allow for organization / speed better than non-clustered indexes can because of how they are physically stored in the database
	keyword CONSTRAINT used somewhere in making them
NULL value
	absence of a value, different from zero
	WHERE example IS NULL, WHERE example IS NOT NULL
	saying WHERE example = NULL is wrong!!!
Candidate key
	a candidate key is a colum that potentially could be used as a primary key. 'it's a minimal Super Key' (dunno what that means)
	example
		locker number is primary key
		lockerserialnumber is candidate key
	example
		A number is primary key, social security number is candidate key
	what is a #term super key
		prof doesnt think its important or very useful but its a combination of rows which could be a candidate key, like having social secutiry number and last name together
Foreign key
	a foreign key is the primary key of one table placed in anothe rtable
	this lets you link the two tables
composite key
	a composite key involves two or more columns that combined, uniquely identify a row
	apparently v iimportant for normalization
	example: student ID and class ID together gives you a grade
	if you dont actually need it it causes a lot of problems which is where normalization comes in
surrogate key
	a unique numberic value added to a relation to serve as the primary key
	apparently you make them by saying IDENTITY (1,1)
	example
		CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER( CustomerNumber INT NOT NULL IDENTITY (1,1),)
	almost always your primary key
	example is the order of students which signed up for class? like first, second, third
	honestly kind of confused
referential integrity
	a method to help maintain a database where the primary key must exist before you can establish a foreign key
	some code stuff
		CONSTRAINT STUDENT_LOCKER_FK FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES STUDENT(StudentID)
	#summary foreign key must exist first 
metadata
	data about the data
	the database itself contains the definition of its structure
	the structure of the tables we build
DDL versus DML
	#term DDL - Data definition language
	#term DML - Data manipulation language
	ddl tasks
		create tables, delete tables, alter tables (adding columns for ex)
	dml tasks
		insert rows of data into tables, delete rows of data in tables, update rows of data, question the database
	ddl is the metadata, dml is the stuff in the tables
