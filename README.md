# Purpose of this REPO

This repository is basically a backup of all of the notes I take while studying CS at Utah State University, and also for personal projects I take on outside of school. I already know how to use Git, so making a backup of all of my notes is kind of a no brainer. Since I use this every day, I commit to this repository the most out of all of my repos.

I use Obsidian, a popular note-taking application. Initially I didn't understand MD formatting, so any notes made before around Feb 2025 are pretty hard to read outside of Obsidian. Newer notes are structured MUCH better, and utilize core features like code blocks (can't believe I wasn't using these!)

You can download Obisidan [here](https://obsidian.md). I don't use any plugins, but there are lots of community created plugins for you to streamline your note taking methods out there somewhere.
