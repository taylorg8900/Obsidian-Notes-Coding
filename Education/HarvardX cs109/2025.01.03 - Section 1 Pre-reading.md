Introduction - Pages 1 to 14
Simple Linear Regression - Pages 61 to 64

#term statistical learning
	refers to a bunch of tools for understanding data
	#term supervised & unsupervised
		basically saying whether we are using the data we have to predict outputs in a certain way, not really a clear distinction right now that is useful to me
#term regression problems
	predicting a continuous output value, like finding the mean line for a bunch of data points
3 real world data sets that are going to be talked about in the book apparently
	1) wage data
		regression
	2) stock market data
		categorical/classification
	3) gene expression data
		clustering
a brief history of statistical learning
	#term least squares + linear regression
		in the early 1800's, this method was developed and used in astronomy. basically it predicts quantitative values
	#term linear discriminant analysis
		used for qualitative value prediction, proposed in 1936, but doesn't explain what it is really beyond what it is used for
	#term logistic regression
		doesnt say what this is for, just that it was developed in the 1940's
	#term generalized linear model
		describes and entire class of statistical learning methods apparently which is cool i guess? would be cooler if more information was given
	basically pre 1970's: linear methods because easy
	after 1970's: non-linear methods, because computer strong
		#term classification and regression trees
		#term generalized additive models
		#term neural networks
		#term support vector machines
			so none of these are elaborated on, i think its just here to show that now we can use computers, things are crazy and impressive and whatever
this book
	basically since people who program are everywhere now they want to make an accessible resource 
	based on the following 4 thingies:
		1) there are lots of statistical learning methods that are relevant outside of stats, and they are presenting the most widely applicable methods
		2) descriptions and comparisons between different aproaches, so you can decide which is more useful
		3) focus more on where methods are useful, and not how they work (so you don't need to be amazing at math)
		4) assume the reader is interested in applying these to real world problems
notation
	n - number of distinct data points
	p- number of variables
	x - denotes a n * p matrix, whose (i,j)th element is xij
	a bunch of extra information about matrixes, and multiplying them together which i do not get at all
