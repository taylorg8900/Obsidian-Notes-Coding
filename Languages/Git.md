(i know git isnt a language bit whatever)

apart from obvious stuff i already know, here are some other useful things
- git show -> view last commit details
- .gitignore file: put stuff in here to not get tracked, obvious but i wasnt using this for notes and i should have been
- git reset \<file\> -> remove file from commit but keep changes
