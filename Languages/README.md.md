# About This Folder
---
I am creating this folder because I seem to be learning a lot of different things very quickly, and I need somewhere centralized to take notes on specific elements of different languages. Learning C and Python was pretty easily because I never went very in depth in them, and the things I learned from classes weren't extremely in depth either. Now that I am learning how to create websites and make minecraft mods, my education is more self-driven, and harder to keep track of. It isn't structured like regular school environments are. 

Because I'm learning in a non-structured way, I need a better way of keeping notes. So that is what this folder is going to be for. 

Here are some of the languages I know so far: 
- C
- Python
- GDScript
- GLSL
- Java
- HTML / CSS / Java

Here are some other things, that aren't languages, that I know:
- JSON files
- Git on CLI
- GitHub
- MD formatting
