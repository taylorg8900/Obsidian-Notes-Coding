so i already got the program working, but im thinking how do i automatically place rooms without needing to specify a direction or a room in particular to be branched off of another room


im thinking what if i had a large object which stored all placed rooms, and we had a function that would go through this and for each available path inside of the placed rooms, the function would try to place a compatible room?
	this would require we had a function that would take a room_save_data and return to us which directional tiles it stores, so we have information about which rooms 
	-what if we had a super large dictionary that stored every room's information at once? instead of having multiple smaller dicts for each room?
		pros:
			more organized
			later on, procedurally placing rocks/enemies/items etc would probably be easier
		cons:
			not really sure if this would be friendly with graph structure, since having all information in one place makes it so rooms aren't their own defined data structure anymore
			backing up and deleting sections of rooms if for some reason a loop can't be placed or something similar kind of wouldn't be possible if i did this 
	-okay backing up to having a large dict, with each key being a room and the values being separate dicts containing coords, source ids, atlas coords, and available paths
		large dictionary
			list of rooms
				4 dictionaries, info about coords/sources/atlas/available paths
	i think this could work with a graph structure, since creating a new room with properties matching our graph, we would be able to place that room and add it to the large dict
		what should i call  the large dict? 
			'rooms'

# func find_and_place_compatible_room
arguments
	dict object which contains information about all .json files' 1) number of paths 2)direction of those paths
	room object which we want to branch a room off of
	how many total paths our to-be-placed room will contain (1=terminal room, 2=2paths,3=3 paths, etc)
return
	we obviously need to return informatino about the rooms that got placed using this function
	the question is if we iterate through all possible paths that aren't used in the room object here or somewhere else
	basically do we only place one room and return one room? or place all possible rooms, and return a list of room dicts
		we could just call the function multiple times using a loop in \_ready, if we are assuming it only places one room at a time
			this way we could just append the return value to the 'rooms' dict
required additional functions for this to work
	a function which gives us information about a room_save_data's total number of paths (total number of directional tiles), and which direction these paths are facing
		need both so that we can 1) find a room with the number of paths we are looking for, and 2) check to see if that room is able to be used (if we want one to branch off to the right, but it has no left directional tiles, then we ignore it for example)
		-information stored inside of a dictionary object (man im using a ton of these), with the key being the name of the room save data, and the values being 3 dictionaries which contain {
			the room's actual save_data, which is what we use get_room_info to find, not the json itself,
			number of total paths the room has,
			available paths that the room contains, such as 'right', 'right', 'down' }
	a function that places hallways between rooms, if the room doesn't fit
		if a hallway can't be placed, then it means it would be impossible to place the room too so return with a message
		if a hallway can be placed, try to place the room after the hallway. if it still doesn't fit, try another hallway
			repeat this a certain number of times before giving up on it 

while not room\["available_paths"].is_empty():
	rooms.append( find_and_place_compatible_room( room_save_data_dict, num_paths, room)

process
	go through arg_dict and find a room with the correct number of total paths 


room_save_data_dict = {
	"First Room": {
		"total_paths: 2,
		"available_paths: {
			"left": \[(20,20)],
			"right:\[(0,20)] },
		"save_data: get_room_info(FIRST_ROOM_PATH)}
}
	the available paths needs to be able to contain all of them for a direction, so we can have some information to pick which one to use later. if we didn't then it would always choose the same entrance during generation, which if we have multiple paths facing the same direction, would make it repetitive if the player came across the same room multiple times. we wouldnt actually use the coordinates for generation here, but knowing the size of the list associated with each direction would is what would let us randomly pick one later

# func get_room_info(file_path)
renaming old get_room_info to get_json_info using ctrl + r 

arguments
	file_path (call get_json_info using this)



ok lowkey i feel confused and kind of overwhelmed with this so imma start over with my thought process
here's the big change i need to make
	have a dictionary, which contains all placed rooms
	effectively just a collection of the rooms that we return with place_room, but held together so we can repeatedly call and modify or add to the same dictionary with repeated calls of a placing function
func place_compatible_room(room, num_paths, rooms_dict)
	idea
		this will, from a room, find a save_data with a compatible path orientation and place it off of one of the room's remaining available paths. After, it will add the newly created room to the rooms_dict, and modify both the original room's remaining available paths, and the newly created room's available paths. 
		If we don't specify a room or a rooms_dict, it will simply place a room with the num_paths we specify

what information do we need to place a compatible room?
	we need to know the amount of paths each save_data contains, and the direction of these paths
		can have each save_data as a key, and the num_paths and directions as the values (which are themselves a dict)
	we need to know the num_paths we want the room to have 
	we need to know off of which room we are placing a new room
		can find by simply iterating through our rooms_dict and grabbing the first room that still has "available paths" left
sidenote
	we can iterate through the rooms_dict, and assign the "new room" key to whatever the return value of this is
	so will almost do a breadth-first search but for placing rooms
	say we want 'room 0' to have 3 paths
	then, the next room we want placed to have 1 path (terminal room)
	we search through the rooms_dict, and if there are available paths for room 0, we place a room and that is what 'room 1' is
	we repeat 
	this would work nicely because we can define the order that we place rooms with a particular target number of paths, but their connections in the scene aren't defined. However, the structure is defined because we can pre define the number of paths for each room before it ever gets placed, and we know in which order they will get placed and be available in the rooms_dict because of this
arguments
	num_paths, rooms_dict, save_file_info
	what in the world do i call the save_file_info argument??
		well what should it contain
			values
				num of paths
				direction of paths
				json info, after using get_json_info on it
		names i could call it
			rooms_info_dict
			save_files_dict
			save_info_dict
			room_info_dict
			room_files_dict
			save_data_dict
			json_files_info_dict
		function to find the information we need (num paths, direction of paths, json information)
			func get_json_files_info(FILE_PATH)
			func return_json_info_dict(FILE_PATH)

ok so we really only need 3 things to place a compatible room
	num of paths we want new room to have
	a bunch of data about the .json files, which tells us their num_paths and directions (for compatibility)
	a dictionary containing all already placed rooms, to search through and find the first one that still has an available path
these arguments are going to be called:
	num_paths, rooms_dict, json_files_info_dict
return value
	a dictionary containing information about room that got placed, like in place_room function
	we add this dictionary to the rooms_dict, outside the scope of this function
conditions
	if no rooms_dict provided, just find a room with the correct num_paths in json_files_info_dict and place it, and return the dictionary describing the room that got placed
process
	first we need to find a room in the json_files_info_dict that has the num_paths we want
