second try at storing and loading stuff from JSON files with tilemaplayer
got a lot of direction after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybjt_EWyL5U), which i have notes on in [[misc functions]] note

func ready()


func place_tiles()
	use set_cell method to set 16 cells
	info needed:
		coords: Vector2i
		source_id: int
		atlas_coords: Vector2i
issues i ran into
	turning the coords from the JSON file into a Vector2i to be used with the set_cell() function
		[this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/4t25y1/string_to_vector2/) might have a good solution, but i dont understand the code yet
		methods "lstrip()" and "rstrip()" seem pretty useful in the [string documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_string.html)
	saying coords_list.size() / 16 returns an int, not a float? 
	saving information to the save_data dictionary by index isn't getting the coords or atlas coords correctly, fix this after eating
	the issue is that the spaces aren't being stripped i think, will find out how to fix this
		strip_edges() might work
		somehow turning "(0" and "0)" into a vector2i ignores the parentheses? not sure how but it works
		
ok got everything figured out
# most important steps of the process:
	1) saving and loading from JSON files, using FileAccess library
	2) turning values stored in the JSON into Vector2i's and ints, to be used correctly in set_cell() method (so turning strings into Vector2i, and floats into int)
what to do next
	i thought about looking into custom resources using the [video from pefeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRZjM9MTGw), then i realized that won't really work for reusing code for storing rooms into JSON files. I looked up "reusing code godot" or something, saw [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/jkg0pi/best_practices_for_code_reuse/) and without really even reading it saw someone mention composition which i remember saving a youtube video on. So I'm going to be looking at that now.
	[this video i had saved in my watch later playlist about composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAjgkqJ-8xQ&list=WL&index=28) is what im going to watch and take notes on
		notes on video:
			Inheritance
				object oriented programming
				making a class with attributes and whatnot
				a con for using inheritance is that for every variation of the class, you are kind of putting yourself in a corner because you have to keep making abstractions of the original class
			composition
				like 'build a bear' somehow
			adding more and more onto the script, different functionalities vs self contained components
			behavior trees
			TLDR: modularity in behaviors and things that can describe a class, instead of one giant code block
	turns out that video wasn't what i wanted but it's still good
	im gonna see if reusing the same script and modifying it once more than 2 scenes are using it changes it across scenes, if not then I'm probably good
	ok so it does change it, but i dont really think that matters that much
	the real issue is going to be making the scene that combines rooms together

combining multiple JSON files together
	goal: for now, just add rooms 1, 2, and 3 from the JSON files in order using the JSON files
	approach
		what information do i need?
			coordinates of where one room already exists in the scene
				used to find how much to add to the coords of the next room
			paths to each room JSON file
				used to actually use JSON and FileAccess to load the information to be used with the set_cell method
		ideas for functions
			func place_next_room():
				-basically this will be what places rooms next to each other
				-will simply place one room to the right of the next one
				-this happens by increasing the Vector2i for each coord in the next room 
				-increase Vector2i by...
				-what if i had a tile in the TileSet that acted as an indicator tile for where the entrances and exits are?
				-what if i had 4 different tiles, that represented the direction that entrances or exits are facing? so if an exit was on the far right of the room, it could say "this exit is pointing out to the right" and have types for each direction
				-[[dead cells room tiles example.png]] adds to this idea, where i believe the spaces where the tiles are can also turn into wall tiles, if they are not used which could be interesting
i think for now i shouldnt be worried about how to align rooms, i should probably just figure out what the bare minimum looks like, which would be placing rooms sequentially without being concerned about their orientation

how would i do that? 
	load each JSON file into it's own variable, using json.get_data() or something
	place the first room ("First Room")
	figure out what coordinates to add to the Second Room using information from First Room coords
		maybe just find out the 'top right coords' of the room in question
			could do this by saying if coord in room is less than current coord, current coord = coord or something if that makes sense (basically iterate through all coords and get the smallest one)
			so find smallest y coord, and largest x coord
		after finding it, add that Vector2i + (1,1) to all of the coords in the room being placed
	place the second room

so probably have a different functions 
	one that places the room, and takes in a Vector2i as it's argument
	one that finds the 'top right' coord of a room and returns it

process
	place room 1
	find room 1's top right coord
	place room 2 using the top right coord value from room 1
	find room 2's top right coord
	place room 3 using the top right coord value from room 2

# idea for function
essentially this function will place a room and simultaeneously return the 'top right' Vector2i coord to be used in the next call for the function
	 so for room one, it doesn't add anything but calling the function for room 2 and passing in the return value from room 1 will place it directly next to room 1
	func place_room(room, coord_amount=0)
		# get's information from the room, and uses set_cell method to place it
		# adds coord_amount to the Vector2i's that denote the coords for the room
		# returns another coord_amount + 1, finding the 'top right corner' of the room + 1 so the next call doesn't place over it
		# this return value is to be used in subsequent calls of the function

after implementing a program that places the rooms sequentially (was actually pretty easy with what i know) i have some ideas for the next thing to do
# **next program**
.
	introduce tiles which store information about room exits
	when placing the next room, find the appropriate 'top corner' of these tiles, and basically extrude them a little bit to figure out where the correct 'target coords' are for the next room
	so essentially it does the same thing as above, but instead of the top right for the entire room, it only returns the 'top right' of these special tiles (whyich i guess i can call EXIT TILES)
	for the next room, get the 'entrance tiles' and get their 'top right' or 'top left' coords
	this will let us align the two rooms together
	do something with subtraction or addition of the room vs the entrance tiles to align them spatially in the scene
before i go writing code, i need to create the tiles that will be used to signify exit/entrance direction
ok now that is done
idea
	what if the return value for the place_room(room_data, coord_amount=Vector2i(0,0)): function is actually an object which contains information about every exit/entrance the room has? this way it works for rooms with one exit, and multiple exits
	.
	what if the room had 2 exits both facing the same way? how would that information get stored?
		store each 'exit' as a key to a dictionary
			the values associated are the coords that belong to that specific exit's 'exit tiles'
			this way, a room can have as many or as little exits as it wants and all of the information gets stored in one data structure which can be returned and used later
			.
			should i have this already in the .json files??
				i think for optimization (and i might just be a dumbass) it would be better to create the dictionaries in the code, so the json files aren't bigger. unless im optimizing for speed. then already having them preloaded would be good.
				I think im just gonna do it in code now, so in the future i already have a framework for it and can right now get that working instead of backtracking and wasting time implementing it in the .json files when im not even sure how to use it
idea for aligning rooms
	since each room's 'exit tiles' are rectangular, why not just find the top right corner for each one?
	after finding the top right corner for each one, depending on direction they are facing, that will determine how we align the next room to it. For example, if the direction is "UP", add Vector2i(0,-4) to the top right corner, and that should be the coordinate of the top right corner of the next room's 'entrance tiles' which are facing "DOWN". "RIGHT" would be Vector2i(4,0) etc

ok brainstorm moment
	instead of returning a Vector2i in the place_room() function, return a dict object containing keys which are the exits, and values which are the top right coord for those exit's 'exit tiles', plus a Vector2i in the direction they represent
		later on will need to implement code for detecting separate exit tile blocks if they are facing the same way, so it doesn't hold only a maximum of 4 exits
ultra brainstrom moment
	here's what i need
	top right corner of exit riles from room 1
	top right corner of entrance tiles from room 2
	add vector2i() depending on direction of exit tiles from room 1
	find offset of corner1+vector2i, and corner2
	this offset is how we align the rooms
