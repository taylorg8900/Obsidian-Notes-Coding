(doing this on 2024.12.16, but the file in godot is named 2024.12.15 since i started yesterday)
continuing from [[2024.12.14 test]]

arguments for place_room
	dict representing previously placed room, with info about directional_tile coords and available paths
	room_save_data for creating a new room
	direction, for determining how room will be placed according to previous room
return value of place_room
	dict object for the room that got placed in the function, with information about directional_tile coords and available paths

return dict
	values:
		available path directions
		coordinates of directional_tiles'

heres how i want it to work
when i call place_room, and give it data for the room to be placed, and a dict representing a room im branching off of, and a direction, i want it to go through the dict and find the coordinates of a directional_tile which is facing the same way as the direction argument, and place the new room according to that. Then, it will modify the dict that was used as an argument and remove the path which was used, and then return to us a new dict object for the newly placed room with it's own information about directional_tile coords, and available paths. If i call the function to place a room, but it isn't possible because the dict object has no available paths from which to place a new room according to the direction argument, it returns and prints out something, but does not place a room.

how i want it to work in the future (after i finish this program)
i want the same functionality as above, but to also be able to call the function and iterate through the dict object and place rooms according to the available paths until there are no more paths available. This way, i wouldnt have to call the function and manually specify the directions of the paths i want to branch off from.

# place_room
arguments:
	dict object (stores information about a room's directional tiles and available paths, that we use to place the new room)
	save_data (what contains information about the new room being placed)
	direction (which direction we want to place the new room off of the previous room / dict object (ex. 'left' = place to the left, if we can))
process
	find offset from previous room and save_data
	.
	create a dict object from the save_data
		values of dict
			coords (determined based on previous room, and how we find the offset for it by comparing directional_tiles from the save_data info and the previous room's dict object)
			source_ids
			atlas_coords
			available paths
				directional_tiles coords, plus an offset of 1 in the direction they are facing
	place new room
		ignore directional_tiles
	modify argument dict
		remove the path being used, which matches the direction argument
	modify to-be-returned dict
		remove the path being used, which is opposite the direction argument
	return dict

list of dictionaries as the value of a key

WHEN IM BACK
heres the rabbit hole
var coords in find_rom_offset doesn't contain anything, if the direction isnt real in the save_data, FIX THIS TO BE SOMETHING because i want the program to still work even if there is no direction_tile in the save_data that matches 
	-i could change find_room_offset to only append to the list it returns if the direction_tile exists in the save_data, but then trying to access the first element of a list of size 0 in place_room wouldn't work
	-i think i just need  to only change the offset from (0,0) if the direction_tile exists in the save_data, in the place_room function
	-i could also just return if there is no direction_tile, which means the function ends early which is what i want if a room can't be placed
what else
	the "available_paths" returns the exact coordinate of the positional_tiles, not the positional_tiles + an offset (because im not calling the find_target_coords function)
	done: modified the find_target_coords function

# finished program
dude this works perfectly haha
what it ignores:
	if we try to place a room that doesn't have a compatible directional tile
	if the room we are coming from doesn't have a path that is compatible with our direction
	if we try to place off a nonexistent room
	if we dont give a direction, or an arg_dict/room argument it still works perfectly
issues:
	my ONLY issue is that i still have to place rooms manually, and already know in my head which paths are gonna be available from which room got placed but man this is way better and user friendly too
	basically i dont really have a way of defining a structure for the generation yet, or a way to randomly choose a room to be placed in accordance to it
other future issues
	it doesn't check to see if the room to be placed would overwrite any existing rooms, which obviously it needs to avoid doing
	i have no way of 'extending' the room, if it does overwrite another one. Like increasing the distance between rooms and adding 'hallway' rooms between them up to a certain point

what if i stored the graph structure in a .json file? to be called in during scene placement?
	not that i know how to utilize or create this, but just an idea instead of defining a bunch of potential structures inside a scene
	.
	what would that look like?
		vertices would be a room with a certain # of edges we want it to have ( 2 total paths = 2 edges)
		edges would just be the connections between hypothetical rooms
		.
		this way, we don't have to know in advance which directions will be chosen for each room, it could just pick a room with the number of paths we want it to have and then get to work
		of course, vertices with only one edge would be a terminal room with only one total path associated with it
		#future_function to determine the number of "available paths" a json file has in it
			maybe all rooms that have the same number of 'available paths' can get stored next to each other in a dict, with the keys being the number of available paths we are looking for 
			this dict is what we call on depending on which part of the graph we are using to place the next room
	okay those are great ideas but like what would the graph look like in code??
		json file (maybe)

#future_idea could just have literal doorways embedded into the side of terminal rooms that the player can go through if i can't figure out how to have loops in my graph structure and get rooms to place correctly. I could also implement these throughout the level in general, and this could enhance the feeling of getting lost in the cave since when you go through one you have no idea where it is taking you. If instead of a loop, i had one at the beginning and another at the end of a section, the player could either walk through it normally or go backwards, but either way it solves the issue of the player potentially needing to backtrack and waste time in areas they don't need to. I guess a good metaphor for how these could work is like the pipes in mario games
	Pro: 
		provides a framework for implementation in other areas, such as providing animation for entering the level, potential uses for linking between separate levels or biomes, or linking completely disconnected areas of a level if i choose to use them that way
		could potentially use to generate disconnected graphs, and connect them and only load in sub-levels when the player approaches or goes through a door, to cut down on loading times for the entire level
	Con: 
		enemy AI pathing would not work with this as well as just getting loops to function correctly.
