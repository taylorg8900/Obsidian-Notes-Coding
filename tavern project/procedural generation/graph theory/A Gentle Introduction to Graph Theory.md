notes from [this website](https://medium.com/basecs/a-gentle-introduction-to-graph-theory-77969829ead8)

a subset of graphs is tree data structures, i have notes in [[How To Not Be Stumped By Trees]]

graphs don't have a 'root node' like tree structures do

# directed graphs
contains directed edges
	an edge that has a direction
	origin node -> destination node

# undirected graphs
contains undirected edges
	origin node and destination node are not fixed

# ordered pairs
(x,y) equivalent for graphs is (vertices, edges)
Graph = (Vertices, Edges)
	G = (V,E)
		where V is a set of nodes / vertices
		where E is a set of edges / links
		[[undirected graph example]] of an undirected graph
		[[directed graph example]]
	V and E are both objects
