i feel like on top of trying to get some kind of algorithm that sees a graph structure, separates it into loop and tree composites, creates layouts for each composite, and stitches them back together to form a level, I also need to have a better idea of what the elements of the game will be. 
	mining
	enemies
	movement
	healing
	weapons

because right now it is actually pretty difficult to structure more than a dozen unique rooms as far as flow is concerned. only being able to jump around makes it really boring to move around the level/rooms, and there really isnt anything interesting going on that i can structure the rooms around either. 

ideas

themes
	theme could be abandoned mineshaft, with ropes hanging from ceiling you can climb up
	theme could be moss cave, with vines hanging from ceiling you can climb up
	theme could be spider next, with silk you can climb up
	theme could be dwarven ruins, with iron chains you can climb up
	theme could be some kind of building, with ladders you can climb up
	theme could be just a cave, with cracks in rocks you can climb up
	theme could be something mystic or magical, with air that lifts you up on it's own
	theme could be mushrooms, with dangly ones you can climb up (shorter)
	theme could be watery, with waterfalls and geysers that carry you down or up
movement
	grappling hook that can only be used in handplaced spots, like from zelda windwaker
	character being able to slide down walls, to avoid falling too quickly and maybe rolling out when he jumps off and hits ground
	being able to grab the edge of a ledge, like at the end of the deeplands video
	swinging pickaxe into a wall, to hang for a bit and stop falling (like jonathon did with the spear in the mansion when he was fighting dio)
		#future_idea if falling quickly, pickaxe slides down the wall before stopping
	'using bursts of steam from portable devices to launch character upward or over large gaps' -chatgpt, i like it
weapons
	crossbow (could also be used as grappling hook launcher)
	shield and waraxe
