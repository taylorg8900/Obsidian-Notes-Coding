[this video on graph rewriting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxeJh2Asigg)might be good, im a little too tired to know if its valuable or not

basically just try to figure out how to create a graph structure for the level before trying to implement it into creating scenes 
id say do it like this
	1. just try to figure out how to represent the level layout in a very basic sense using graph theory
		first of all, make a room that only has one path, like a basic starting room
		then make a copy but facing the other way
		and use any of the currently made rooms (1-5) to be what is in between them
			so something like room1: 1 path, room2: 2 paths, room3: 1 path
	1. try to use that in a script to generate a level
	2. try to translate that information into a .json file
	3. use the .json file to generate the level, instead of using a block of code in the script

honestly this part might be just as complicated as the whole process from learning how to place tiles, how to create json files, and everything ive done in the room placement test files over the past few/several days. but i think since i have some sort of framework and very clean code to modify if i need or to take ideas from, actually generating levels wont be that hard once i can connect them to the layouts i create.
