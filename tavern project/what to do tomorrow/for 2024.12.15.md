get to work on aligning rooms based on their exits
come up with a better name for exits/entrances
	doorway? door? entrance? exit? passage? gate? corridor? aisle? lane? path?
	i like passage and path
look at the bottom of [[2024.12.13 test]] for idea on how to align rooms based on the offset of the path tiles, and storing information in a dictionary object
notes will be in [[2024.12.14 test]]
