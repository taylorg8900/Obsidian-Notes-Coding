get to work on [[2024.12.13 test]] 
goals:
	create a save function to save the tiles 
	create another function that places the saved tiles in a new, random location within camera view
	create a reset function that places a tile block somewhere, that doesn't get put into a JSON file and just exists because i can imagine the save function being overwritten easily

func ready()


func place_tiles()
	use set_cell method to set 16 cells
	info needed:
		coords: Vector2i
		source_id: int
		atlas_coords: Vector2i
issues i ran into
	turning the coords from the JSON file into a Vector2i to be used with the set_cell() function
		[this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/4t25y1/string_to_vector2/) might have a good solution, but i dont understand the code yet
