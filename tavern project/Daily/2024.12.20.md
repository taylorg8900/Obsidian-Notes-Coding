ok so what would make the flow of the levels fun?
	i dont want long tree structures, since that would make the player backtrack
	i feel like on one hand, the player might feel like they want to clear out an entire level before returning but i dont necessarily want that to happen
		i feel like dave the diver does a good job where exploring every inch of the level is actually sort of a waste of your time
		im thinking about the 3d caves in lethal company and sons of the forest,  where trying to explore every single path is really hard just because you get lost and cant keep track of where youve been before
		and also one of the things i liked about caving in minecraft was that i would go and explore every branch of a cave even if it meant backtracking a lot 
maybe i can frame this in a certain way
	loop favorable 
	tree favorable
	neither tree or loop favorable

examples of games that im thinking fit in each
	loop favorable
		gta v?, dave the diver, amongus?, backrooms level 1, water level from apeirophobia
	tree favorable
		woodland mansions minecraft, villages minecraft, murky divers, minigame level from recent backrooms game, maze shrines botw, slime rancher
	neither
		lethal company, phasmophobia mental asylum map

what i dont want
	water level from apeirophobia
		because it was just way too open man, always going over places youd already been
	backrooms level 1
		way too open, constantly running into places youd already been
	dave the diver
		also too open and covering areas you have already been to when you swim across areas to get everything in an area
	minecraft woodland mansion
		i felt like it was boring travelling along a main path, and any sort of branches were only one room deep and never really went anywhere so you were just walking down this line forever and not actually 'exploring'
	yujiros mansion
		having each floor be a giant loop with rooms branching off made it feel annoying to constantly go over the same areas over and over again
what i liked about exploring different games
	amongus
		each section of the map was like it's own little sub area in my head and it let me keep track of where things were, even if the map was one giant loop
	minecraft caves
		clearing out caves and sectioning them off made me feel like 'ok i am done exploring there, i never need to go back because i got everything' and i guess let me keep a map in my mind of places i had been
	lethal company
		same as for minecraft caves, but you could also get lost and not remember how to get out because of how many branches there are
	minecraft dungeon thing mod
		i really liked completely exploring a floor and having to keep track of where i had been before leaving, and how there could be a lot of different paths to explore as you went along one 'main path'

ok so things that i dont like
	1) having the level just be one big ass loop with a lot of little trees branching off of it
		this makes it feel like the same as exploring one long tree, until you realize it is a loop and then you are going back through it multiple times to find something new
	2) having trees that are extremely long, and if there are subtrees only being like one room deep so you return to the 'main tree' and keep going until you hit a dead end
	3) not having any trees, or branched contained loops so it feels like you're constantly going through the same area to find something new 

feedback after spending all day making 2 levels for korbin to playtest
	larger rooms feel better
	he got way more lost on the one that had loops in it
	having trees is a good thing as well, it makes it easier to traverse 
	large open spaces feel like rooms, not just being a connection between two spaces

what ive learned
	more loops = player feels more lost, and the level feels bigger
	making everything by hand is a fucking pain in the ass and not worth it
	larger rooms feel better, the space above the players head makes a big difference in how it feels to travel through areas
	i need to implement a climbing mechanic soon, so having cramped jump ups isnt an issue
	sub trees are also a good thing to have and not the boogeyman like i thought

so moving on i need an algorithm that is capable of handling trees and loops, with an even mix of both. also having a larger size for rooms is good 
	i think having small trees in between loops would also be good for players to orient themselves, i can mess with  that when i have an algorithm going

ok basically
	even mix of loops and sub trees, with 1-2 long trees between loops
	i need something that can handle both loops and trees, and i can mess with things like subtrees attached to loops or between loops or only having trees or only having loops etc once i have it working
