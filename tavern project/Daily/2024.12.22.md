yeah today i figured out how to use github which is actually huge, and also stole some codeto make the player feel good and not cringe and bad ie jumping and moving actually feels normal now

next thing is to get gems and stuff
-outline for which one is selected
-animation for smashing the rocks
-some kind of HUD that updates when you pick up a gem
-when you smash the rock pile, make the gem pop out and fall onto the ground
-maybe have small idle animation play for gems, like a shimmer that goes around every few seconds to make it look shiny

also check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsy8pknHc0M) to maybe also include stuff for the player trying to jump right before they hit the ground

#future_idea rock monster that eats rocks and becomes bigger or faster
#future_idea rock monster that splits into smaller rock monsters if take damage
#future_idea rock monster that you need to power attack to kill, shooting doesn't do anything also moves really slow
#future_idea rock monster that runs away from you, has a lot of gems embedded in itself that will drop when killed (like huuli hoarder in drg)

#important figure out how to use a custom resource to pick the types of gems that are in the rock. Have an option for 'random' along with a list of potential gems, or manually select the count of each gem type. Something that dynamically lets you select various gems to be placed, and not just a shit load of different sprites for all different possible combinations for each type of rock
	for instance if i have just for the type of rock that can hold 3 gems at once, 8 of those types of rocks, and 9 total gems, then thats like a bajillion possible sprites i would have to make by hand
