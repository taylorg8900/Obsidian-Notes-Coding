(section from previous day)
ok brainstorm moment
	instead of returning a Vector2i in the place_room() function, return a dict object containing keys which are the exits, and values which are the top right coord for those exit's 'exit tiles', plus a Vector2i in the direction they represent
		later on will need to implement code for detecting separate exit tile blocks if they are facing the same way, so it doesn't hold only a maximum of 4 exits
ultra brainstrom moment
	here's what i need
	top right corner of exit riles from room 1
	top right corner of entrance tiles from room 2
	add vector2i() depending on direction of exit tiles from room 1
	find offset of corner1+vector2i, and corner2
	this offset is how we align the rooms

# second place_room function
goals:
	place a second room, using information about where to align path tiles (direction for selecting correct type of path tiles,  and target coordinates to actually place the room correctly)
arguments: 
	room_save_data, (information to be used in set_cell method, information to use in find_path_tiles_corner_coords)
	direction (direction of tiles to look for, will pass in as argument for find_path_corner_coords())
	target_coords (the coordinate of the path we are aligning to, will pass in as argument for find_room_offset())
returns:
	object storing information about this rooms path tiles **after being placed** in the scene, to be used to calculate offset later
	(maybe just create a new object, which is a copy of the room_save_data but with modified coords, so can be passed into find_path_tiles_corner_coords() easily)

# func find_path_tiles_corner_coords
arguments
	room_save_data (so we have something to look through)
	tile direction we are looking for (up, right, down, left facing tiles in the TileSet)
returns:
	an dictionary containing values which represent the bottom right corner coords for each path, so that we can have multiple paths which are also facing the same way

\# function to find the offset between a rooms target path corner coordinate, and where it should be in the scene which we use to align the room when we actually place it using the place_room function
# func find_room_offset
arguments
	room_save_data (will call find_path_tiles_corner_coords, to give us something to compare with target_coords argument)
	target_coords (the coordinates that we are finding offset using)
returns:
	Vector2i (what we add to the room in place_room so it aligns properly)

additional thoughts
	i think by default, finding the bottom right corner would be easier to read/troubleshoot rather than having options for multiple corners like 'top right' 'bottom left' etc, because it's just the max x and max y of the path tiles
		this made me realize that i cant have rectangles as the markers for path tiles, because different heights would mess up the find_path_tiles_corner_coords function for tiles facing UP and DOWN, when it comes to adding a Vector2i to find what the 'target coords' are later on. If I accidentally in a room had a height of 5 instead of 4, and was just using 4 as convention, then aligning the rooms that way would be off and I might not catch it easily. also finding bottom right works extremely well
			wouldnt i actually need the capability of finding each corner for when i compare two rooms paths together? actally, this might not matter
			actuallyy yeah this wouldnt matter since each each 'block' is just one tile wide or high dpedning on it's direction
	what if i just had one directional tile for each path, so it's really easy to create the object which stores multiple coordinates that is the return value of the find_path_tiles_corner_coords function? 
		this would also be really good for later, when im placing lots of rooms in a level, for making the program slightly quicker because it wouldn't have to iterate through an additional list in the function
	after getting the program working (added another function called find_target_coords), I realize that a flaw of how i set up the arguments to each function is that I have no way of finding the target_coords for subsequent rooms just by passing in information from the JSON files, since they are at different coordinates than the rooms placed in the scene. I have two options here i think:
		1) actually go and create the second PLACE_ROOM function, and have a return value as described above which lets me find out what the next offset should be
		2)  modify my find_target_coords function to use something other than information from the JSON file
	==what if i had a class which described the room data?==
		why do i need this?
			so i can pass in
			actually i might not need this after all
		rethinking if this could be useful
			this actually COULD be useful, if i made an object that contained information from the JSON files, and also information about things like where it is placed in the scene and the direction_tile's coordinates and stuff it could make using functions a little bit easier
			if i hit a wall I should come back and consider doing this
# after completing the program
thoughts
	i feel like the process of placing subsequent rooms is pretty clunky, because i have to find out what the the offset is and also what the dictionary is each time i want to place a room, which is two lines of code. that makes it sound like i hate typing but im really just trying to think on how im going to automate this 
		i need a way to store both the multiple paths that a room has, and also offsets associated with each path
			so if a room had a left and a right exit, both of those would store their own coordinates representing where the target coordinate they point to is 
	new naming conventions
		i need something new for the directional tiles, because im switching between saying path tiles and directional tiles and direction_tile in the code
		DIRECTIONAL_TILE is the new name i have decided
		PATH will be used to describe used or unused exits and entrances in and out of rooms
	i need to find the offset in the place_room function, and return it along with the other information
		what information again?
		when i place a room, i need to return a dictionary
			what are the keys in the dictionary?
				i think just "right" "left" "up" "down" 
			well hold on what are the VALUES?
				can't be offset, since it wouldnt be possible to find that without calling it separately which i dont want to do
				i guess just **lists of coords** that represent each directional tile in the room that was just placed
arguments in the place_room function
	direction 
		basically if it's right, then place the new room TO THE RIGHT etc
		this should be enough information to find the offset compared to the target_coords and place a new room
	dict
		im just trying to think of how to remove values as we place new rooms from the dict, if a room has more than 1 not used exit
	room_data
		cuz we need a way to say which room we want to place next
