ok so i got my program running that will use a pseudo graph structure and place rooms according to the number of paths they have, and whichever rooms in the json files are compatible with that specification in accordance to already placed rooms. All that is to say it works, EXCEPT, i dont have any way to prevent the rooms from overlapping each other. So the next step is to introduce code to make it so somehow, if a room gets placed and overlaps another room, we do something to rearrange the scene to make it all fit. I don't really know how to get this working, so I will brainstorm

ideas
	simply extend the overlapping room out to the side until it is no longer overlapping, then connect using hallways
		which room do we extend? the one to be placed, or all of the ones that already are placed?
		what if it is impossible to place a hallway? how do we rearrange the rooms or replace them? 

notes from [enter the gungeon generation](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2019/07/28/dungeon-generation-in-enter-the-gungeon/) that i should look at 
	'injection' which is used for special rooms, is worth remembering 
		#future_idea 'injecting' special rooms, like enter the gungeon
	'connector nodes' 
		which are just what i imagine hallways to be. According to this, it seems like they aren't procedurally generated? Maybe they are premade and placed in between rooms, and have varying sizes. I don't know if that would be better or not, but it's not like I would know how to use either method (between procedurally generating hallways or placing predefined ones)
	composites
		smaller parts of the larger graph structure that defines the level
		either a single loop of rooms, or a tree
		no fucking way i just found all of the charts and graphs that enter the gungeon uses lmao im definitely keeping these, they are tavernproject > random pdfs > enter the gungeon level charts
			something im noticing is that loops never connect directly to each other, there is always some room in between loops. Why? or i guess i should say there is never more than one edge connecting two loops
			examples of one edge between 2 loops: F2_Gungeon_Flow_01, F5_Forge_Flow_02_TheChain. 
			is it really that hard to implement that or were they trying to avoid it for player experience? because i would want to have it to enhance that getting lost feeling that the player would have
			maybe it is like that because it would be impossible to create a composite the way i would want it? i have to keep reading on how the composites are even decided
		how composites are formed
			'finding the smallest loop in the map, and cutting it out as a composite. This is repeated until no loops are left. the rest of the map is a bunch of disconnected trees, and connections between individual composites'
		fuck my brain is starting to hurt again that must mean im learning
		okok
	composite layout
		each composite is then laid out separately in a separate map they get composed together later
			interesting
		to layout a composite the first room is put in an arbitrary spot, then rooms are added one by one (in the exact same way that i have my program) 
		.
		specifically tree composites:
			it basically does what my program would do if it only checked for overlapping rooms and tried to pick a room that didn't overlap. apparently, it also will [try to backtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) if 'layout isn't possible', so either it tried to place a room that doesn't overlap 3 times max, or if it goes through every possible room that doesn't overlap and nothing works, will regenerate the room it's trying to branch off of and start again 3 times before giving up and making a new composite.
		specifically loop composites
			it starts by placing rooms like normal, with a preference for exits on opposite sides (up-down, right-left paths), and then when the loop is half filled, switches and prefers exit pairs which are adjacent (up-right, down-right, down-left etc)
			after making all of the rooms, if it can place a regular hallway thing in between it does. otherwise, it pathfinds and makes a procedurally generated hallway instead with a constraint on how long it can possibly be (longer than 30 'units' is no good)
			im assuming if it can't make the hallway part work, it restarts until it has one that works
	#future_idea call the level generator 'dungeonator' or 'caveonator' or something

ok so considering the way the program works right now (despite not having any actual safeguards in place, whoops) is basically using a tree structure. I'm not linking rooms together in a graph way at all, so i could definitely try and implement structuring 'tree composites' in the same way as enter the gungeon, where it attempts to place a room as long as it doesn't overlap any previous rooms. The part i don't really get is what it means about backtracking. I'm pretty sure it means if there is literally no room that works, it will backtrack to the previous room and attempt to repeat the same thing but with a replacement room. This would be a good place to get to work, mostly because I don't really know how to tackle that but learning how will give me a better understanding on how to fuck with the rooms_dict data structure i have made. 

apparently backtracking is a specific form of Depth First Search, where it is applied to problems that require exploring a space under contraints (im asking chatgpt questions rn, prompt was 'can you explain backtracking in procedural generation?')
	i guess this makes sense for why the article only mentioned it in the tree composites and not the loop composites
#future_idea [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)will probably help a lot in the future for making things run faster, optimization

[this video on backtracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBC_Fd8EE8A)is pretty good

next steps
1.
	either implement safeguards for current program or
	move straight onto implementing backtracking to place only correct rooms, or remove and replace a room if no viable rooms can be placed off of it
2.
	figure out how to 'composite' trees versus graphs, which will also require me actually setting up a graph data structure for level generation ('caveonator')
3.
	implement loops 

constraint satisfaction problems?

idea
	#important what if i stored a rooms 'available paths' and had another thing called 'used paths' that kept track of which paths got used. Then if i had to backtrack, i do something with 'used paths'. so available paths would always stay the same. maybe i could call that something else, like 'all paths'
		this is a good idea because it lets me go back and modify rooms in the rooms_dict, if i use a graph structure and need to work my way backwards and do things with previous rooms. since im keeping information about the directional tiles always, it should be easy to find a new compatible room and try placing it. i think this would let me do what enter the gungeon does for it's 'backtracking' thing.
		i think this is actually going to be the key to making it all work. just like storing rooms and json file information in a dict was a huge step forward

i think before i move on to anything else, i need to figure out how to use a graph structure to place rooms. I need this so i can have a very concrete definition of where rooms should be in relation to each other, and so that i can backtrack through the graph in case no viable rooms can be placed inside of a composite tree structure.

counting number of edges in the graph will let us find out how many directional tiles that room needs to have

#future_idea hexagon shapes for particle effects, they look satisfying for some reason 

12.19.2024 
ok so what should i actually do next? It might be more efficient if i try to implement a way to separate loops and tree composites at the same time as im implementing this backtracking feature, even though i wont get started with loops until after the backtracking is working. i think i need to figure out broadly how to represent the level layout with a graph structure, using the edges between rooms to find and place rooms with the correct number of paths, and using backtracking for sections of the graph that can be organized into tree structures.
I don't know how effective it would be to actually implement a function or some code to separate the graph into composites, since i dont even know how i would get the pathfinding to work to place hallways between parts of the loop.
If all I'm doing so far is using the graph in a tree way, then i dont need to be able to seperate into composites
i still think it would be valuable to have something that can seperate it so that i dont need to try and figure out how to do that later, after i implement backtracking and move on. if i approach the backtracking with the graph structure without planning for loops, then i might make unusable code later on.

==and here is what it said about the process, in case i need ideas:== 

To achieve this, you need to separate the nodes into subgroups based on whether they are part of a **loop** or **tree** in the context of the connected component. Specifically, we can refine the algorithm to check each connected component for cycles and isolate the nodes accordingly.

Here’s how we can modify the program:

1. **Refine the `is_tree` function:** Instead of classifying an entire component as a tree or a loop, identify which specific nodes are part of cycles.
    
2. **DFS to Detect Cycles:** Perform a DFS and track back edges to find cycles in the component.
    
3. **Separate Nodes:** Once the cycle-detection logic identifies the nodes in loops, classify the remaining nodes as tree nodes.
    

Here’s the updated Python code:

Edited

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Cycle Detection:**
    
    - A `detect_cycles` function uses DFS to find all nodes that are part of cycles within a connected component.
2. **Node Classification:**
    
    - Nodes are classified as part of a loop if they belong to a detected cycle. Remaining nodes are classified as trees.
3. **Tree and Loop Separation:**
    
    - Each connected component is split into tree nodes and loop nodes.

### Example Output:

For the given graph:

- Nodes `6` form a tree.
- Nodes `7, 8, 9` form a loop.

**Output:**


`Tree components: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6]] Loop components: [[7, 8, 9]]`

This approach ensures precise separation based on the membership of nodes in trees or loops.

==here's something that google AI spat out at me when i googled how to separate a graph into trees and loops:== 

To separate a graph into trees and loops, you can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to identify cycles within the graph, then remove the edges that form those cycles to isolate the tree-like components; essentially, you are left with a collection of trees by removing the edges that create loops in the original graph.

- Connected components: If the original graph is not connected, you will need to perform a separate DFS traversal for each connected component to identify their respective trees and loops. [[1](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/cgt_online/book/section05.05.html), [2](https://www.vaia.com/en-us/textbooks/math/introductory-combinatorics-5-edition/chapter-11/problem-53-prove-that-a-graph-is-a-tree-if-and-only-if-it-do/#:~:text=A%20graph%20is%20a%20tree%20if%20it,cycle%20if%20a%20new%20connection%20is%20added).), [4](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Tree#:~:text=A%20connected%20non%2Doriented%20graph%20G%20which%20does,has%20no%20multiple%20edges%20and%20no%20loops.)]
- Handling multiple loops: If a single cycle contains multiple loop edges, you only need to remove one of them to break the cycle.

Example:

  

Imagine a graph with vertices A, B, C, D, E, and edges (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, E), (E, A), (C, E).

- DFS traversal:
    - Starting at A, you would visit B, C, D, E, and then back to A.
    - When visiting E from D, you would detect a cycle because E has already been visited, marking the edge (E, A) as a loop edge.
- Removing loop edges:
    - Remove the edge (E, A).
    - The resulting graph would be two trees: one with vertices (A, B, C, D) and another with (E).
