sub trees in between loops
	this could be where the grappling hook things are, letting players swing across to new areas

ideas

themes
	theme could be abandoned mineshaft, with ropes hanging from ceiling you can climb up
	theme could be moss cave, with vines hanging from ceiling you can climb up
	theme could be spider next, with silk you can climb up
	theme could be dwarven ruins, with iron chains you can climb up
	theme could be some kind of building, with ladders you can climb up
	theme could be just a cave, with cracks in rocks you can climb up
	theme could be something mystic or magical, with air that lifts you up on it's own
	theme could be mushrooms, with dangly ones you can climb up (shorter)
	theme could be watery, with waterfalls and geysers that carry you down or up
movement
	grappling hook that can only be used in handplaced spots, like from zelda windwaker
	character being able to slide down walls, to avoid falling too quickly and maybe rolling out when he jumps off and hits ground
	being able to grab the edge of a ledge, like at the end of the deeplands video
	swinging pickaxe into a wall, to hang for a bit and stop falling (like jonathon did with the spear in the mansion when he was fighting dio)
	'using bursts of steam from portable devices to launch character upward or over large gaps' -chatgpt, i like it
	sprint -> pickaxe slam -> launches you
	holding jump for certain amounts of time makes you jump a certain height
		pretty much how it works in every other game ever
	something for hitting shift
		maybe could just be sprinting
	crawling if holding s + d or s + a
weapons
	crossbow (could also be used as grappling hook launcher)
	shield and waraxe
	weapon wheel
		gun
		crossbow
			grappling hook
			rope arrow
		cairn
		flamethrower
healing
	drinking ale
	health bar looks like regular legend of zelda type hearts 
	maybe rubies are like health pickups? 

HUD
	health
	current weapon, ammo
	gold collected
		can either pool all gems and minerals into one value, or have a list like DRG with amounts

aight so basically so i dont burn out or spend too much effort in one place im gonna try to implement a bunch of this stuff with the worst pixel art ever, also im sick of the current tile scheme and i think if the player can control how high they jump then having jump ups at a set height is kind of dumb. having slants would be cool too. I'm inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1himub8/just_launched_my_godot_game_fountains_thank_for/) where people are agreeing that focusing on gameplay and character control first is better. I also think it would give me more direction for what to do with rooms and room design.
	make low effort tile set
		#future_idea implement autotiling, like from [this inbound shovel vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j_B8Ra3TY4&list=LL&index=1)
	make low effort hud elements (health, weapon, ammo, minerals collected, ale tankards)
	make low effort rock piles with various gems
	make low effort weapon wheel
	make low effort
	fix camera in the game, so it always displays a size of 320 x 180
	fix player jumping mechanic
