		MITx: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python)
			would probably not learn anything from this
		MITx: [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science)
			this could be good
		HarvardX: [Introduction to Data Science with Python](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-science/harvard-university-introduction-to-data-science-with-python?webview=false&campaign=Introduction+to+Data+Science+with+Python&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fharvardx)
			"Learn the concepts and techniques that make up the foundation of data science and machine learning."
			this could be super useful
		HarvardX: [Remote Work Revolution for Everyone](https://www.edx.org/learn/remote-work/harvard-university-remote-work-revolution-for-everyone?webview=false&campaign=Remote+Work+Revolution+for+Everyone&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fharvardx)
			could be useful in the way that finding out about obsidian and github is useful
		HarvardX: [Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-using-python-for-research?webview=false&campaign=Using+Python+for+Research&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fharvardx)
			"Take your introductory knowledge of Python programming to the next level and learn how to use Python 3 for your research."
		theres honestly just a shitload of CS courses here that i could take advantage of
		i think probably do this
			finish [cs50](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science?webview=false&campaign=CS50%27s+Introduction+to+Computer+Science&source=edx&product_category=course&placement_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edx.org%2Fschool%2Fharvardx)
			do another [harvard course](https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx#programs) because there are like dozen other ones
			put both on resume
	leetcode problems
