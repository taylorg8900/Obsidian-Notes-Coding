i think the next thing before i actually try to implement graphs (since i honestly have no idea about any part of it im gonna be real with you chief) is to try and conceptualize what flow the levels should actually have

constraints
	- i dont want to make the player have to backtrack more than 2 rooms at once
	- i dont want loops larger than 4 rooms to not include their own sub-trees, or side rooms

maybe the levels should be a bunch of loops that branch off of each other in a way that each one can be it's own loop. let me make a drawing to explain
	fuck it i have a drawing on my whiteboard when i get to work tomorrow just think about it
