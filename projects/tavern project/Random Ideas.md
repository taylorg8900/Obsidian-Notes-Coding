sticker system
	buffs are applied as stickers you have to put onto an item
	lets people customize their thing (whatever it will be idk yet) like how people decorate laptops and water bottles IRL
	'thwap' text effect when placing
	particle effect when placing, like the little sparks that you see in simple animations
tavern
	like dave the diver
	have to go into a cave system to find more
	enemy types that drop different items to craft the drinks
	maybe instead of enemies dropping food, they drop minerals that 'augment' some item in the tavern which is what makes all of the drinks
	like how there's npcs in media that dispense beer, like Lloyd in DRG or the bartender in Passengers movie etc
	there could be a big machine in the back that is kept there to create your beer with some magic type dealio that isnt important
	hole in the back next to it to get into the cave
	very sketchy room im thinking, but the front of the shop is like shiny and fun and cool
	could implement a horror aspect to all of this where serving the guests is like a relaxing area but the main game is dark and dingy and kind of creepy
		serving guests could just be automatic, theres a time incentive to keep going back down into the cave hole to get minerals
		but you can check on the state of your tavern if you want and it pauses time(?)
	maybe there can be a cart or something that you put the minerals in you have to protect from enemies
		opens up playstyles from like defending the cart builds, or damage builds that collect minerals faster, or farm based builds that can collect minerals better without having to fight the enemies, or builder type builds that keep enemies away really efficiently
		could be two different 'dive' types into the hole
			light dives where you dont have the cart to defend, just a rucksack and its a quick in and out deal
			heavy dives where you defend the cart and its slower and more defense based
			light dives give less and eventually youd have to do some heavy dives
			if you do only heavy dives, miss out on specific resources that you can only get in light dives
				maybe an aspect of you can go quicker alone but farther together
	maybe you can have recruitable npcs that defend the cart on their own
		npcs can also be how you get unlockable gear for your light dives, such as flares or special ammo or clothes or bonuses to stats etc
	weapons dont have to be normal weapons, can be based around digging tools
		i feel like digging tools as melee weapons is a good idea to explore
			maybe you could have 1) your 'gun' and 2) your 'shovel'
				better gun is better
				better shovel gets minerals faster 
		different gear for light and heavy dives, incentivizes seperate loadouts and exploring mixing and matching gear
	a special weapon that uses the ale from the tavern as a gun, very special and unique effects on enemies or bonuses at the cost of taking resource from your bar and making the timer go down faster or like reduce your potential sales etc
		useful if you have like too much stuff or need a hail mary pass to keep the bar from going out of business if your gear just isnt good enough to keep things running 
		could introduce by having the player almost have the tavern go out of business early on in the game, to show that it is almost like a trump card type weapon like deku blowing his arms up in MHA sort of deal
	stickers can be given to the player when they upgrade their shipments using minerals
		maybe minerals should be used to buy upgrades from vendors? or like a black market type deal?
			makes me think of in ratatouille when they pay off the grocers to give them the best produce at the beginning of the day
		like a 'loyalty' system with the dealers
		maybe the minerals in the cave are like drugs for the dealers so theres like a drug empire aspect to this
		maybe your tavern is like a front for the drug business you're really running in there
	stickers can be placed on a locker near the hole or something like that so you can see it and mess with it before jumping in there
		could be placed on a chest or like a gun locker or like a regular locker or something idk
		or could be on a lantern that you take down there to light things up
			lantern can go on the end of your gun or on your hip 
				reminds me of Dr Shultz when he rolls up and frees Django at the beginning of the movie
	text effects
		"Blam" when shooting (and others duh)
		"dink" when mining (and others duh) would be smaller than the shooting effects
	first person mode when mining?
		like how doing tasks in among us pulls you into a seperate state / window / mini game
		absolutely cannot be obnoxious
		could be like you have to try and find the weak points based on the shape of the vein you are looking at
		or like hitting on the point parts will weaken it or change its shape and make it crumble and come out of the wall
		can shoot the vein to go faster but it wouldnt give you all of its resource
			or like power slam with your digging tool so you avoid going into menu and its kind of fun to watch the character just smash it to bits in one big attack
			pros: is faster, fun to watch, satisfying, really badass and a hell yeah moment
			cons: less resources
			if i add more cons i am gay and it takes away from player experience
	pick 2 system from jetpack joyride
		honestly dont know what i could come up with ideas from this but could be interesting
		i liked the different styles you could have with it and freedom of choice
		but yeah no ideas on how this would even work or make sense, just something interesting
		maybe i will come up with something the next time i see this 
	drop zones 
		maybe later in the game, i could introduce how a new section of the cave was discovered by one of the npcs that helps you run this whole shebang
		and the section is a mysterious abandoned minecart track with ropes and pulleys that lead into different areas of the cave
		doesnt replace the main loop
		opens up new areas that have special items? or like more of one type of mineral than another, but overall gives less (so that if the player is broke on one type, they can access this specifically but it isn't sustainable to only run these special zones)
		like 70% total minerals overall, but in that 70% the majority of it is that one type of mineral you are after
		maybe different vendors you get your supply from are hooked on different 'drugs' and you sometimes need to dive in there to get that specific drug or theyll rage out and do some drug addict type shit on your tavern
	late game ideas
		after a while a new drop zone was discovered by your npc that found the original minecart and pulley rope system thing
		in it a super special rare never seen before crystal is found
		when you go in to check it out and mine it, there was actually a spy from a rival business following you and a small cutscene plays of him running away after seeing it
		now word has gotten out about this 'ultimate' mineral
		you have to fight your suppliers and the rival business using your gear and the ale gun is the final trump card / power up that you use to end the game
			like when all might uses united states of smash, that is like your ale gun and you need to use up all of your last supply from the tavern to make it out of there alive or beat the enemies that have it out for you
		game ends with you having the ultimate crystal resource, and no need to run the drug empire anymore since your customers/ suppliers that use them are gone
			can now use the mine shaft to produce just ale which is your passion all along
			maybe the Lloyd type machine in the back gets repurposed to use the minerals as a clean power source now, and your tavern is now pretty much legal and its a nice resolution
			works since there is no more conflict and the story is over
		maybe end it with like a newspaper story segment picture
			headline is something like 'business booms at (player name's) tavern!' which is like a nod to how there are explosions and whatever at the final fight or like the climax of that fight ends in a massive explosion
		also it would be cool for when the final fight ends, the penultimate god mineral crystal thing blows up too
			would want this so it wraps up the story, and the whole escalation for power and stronger mineral drugs ends with the defeat of the people who are trying to take it all away from you since they are gone and so is the ultimate crystal they were after
	mission powerups
		powerups that only last for that mission
		depend on the ale you make
		i guess i just want the player to be able to also drink ale
		the more drunk the player is, the more they get from power smashing the mineral nodes
			could also make the player miss more shots like how in Xcom you can miss even when it looks like you dont lol
			the bullet just goes past the enemy instead of stopping when hitting the enemy model	
	2d 
		dont know if i need to state this since i have an image in my head but yes this game would have to be 2d
	player is a dwarf
		yeah i think this would be sick and i like the idea of them having a big beard 
		oh maybe since they are shorter than people the light dives are more like cramped spaces 
			would explain why npcs cant follow you in
			or instead of the whole level being cramped, just the in between space 
	rival business
		pops up mid game
		ends up story wise being a ruse, a plot by the drug people to try and extort you by getting you to give them more and more and more over time or 'theyll go to the other business'
		(player doesn't know that though, and it acts as an incentive to do more or risk the tavern shutting down and the game ending)
		the spy that sees you get to the ultimate crystal in the last drop zone is from the rival business
			the rival business ended up being a sort of base of operations for an alliance between all of the drug guys
	really need a name for these drug people that you are selling the minerals to
		maybe instead of them being the ones taking the drugs and getting high from them, their produce business is a front just like how your tavern is a front 
		their reason for trying to extort you and kill you to get the ultimate crystal is so their front can perform even better and they can get filthy rich selling it 
		"producers" ? could be a good name
			since they 'produce' the goods for your tavern to run, and they i guess give you produce
		they end up allying over a shared interest in killing you during the distributions to your business they all do separately
			like during the shipments they start becoming more familiar and start talking about your business --> they get curious together --> they gang up due to shared interest in taking over your mine
			their group just needs to wait for a moment that makes it worth it for them to kill you and go down into the cave themselves... which wont be until they discover the ultimate crystal by following you
	health potions
		i want this to be a system like the flask in dead cells, but instead of a panaceum thingy its just the ale from your tavern
		this makes sense because you are a badass dwarf and of course ale is what heals you up
	weapon idea
		flamethrower
			low tier flamethrower is you putting ale in your mouth, and spitting it out with a match in front of your mouth which ignites it like a flamethrower
			mid tier flamethrower is just powered by your ale
			this could even be the starting weapon, since it wouldnt cost the player anything and it could be introduced as like an old family technique that was passed down or something lmao
				used until you find a gun in a chest or something
		axe cuz dwarf hell yeah
			could be first melee weapon and digging tool
			initially can only dig with using it and power smashes, and later unlocking a pickaxe to unlock the vein dig minigame thing that gives you extra comp
	pickaxe as dig tool, axe as vein smash tool
	ok im sleepy now but i really like this so far
	flashlight on gun, lantern on belt
	flares like in DRG as a tool
	rope as a traversal tool
	moss cave biome
	name of game
		"borgen's tavern" or something like that, like something dwarven followed by tavern 
			this could be the opposite of cooking not sure
	potential names of the dwarf
		Balin
		Thrain
		Borin
		Skorn <- i like this one
		Odrik
		Thorin
		Varric
		Gundar
		Keldorn
		Kragg
		Haldar
		Thorek <- i like this one
		Bromir
		Harnak
		Torgrim
		Rurik
	potential last names
		Flintheart
		Blackstone
		Stonehand
	Crawling mechanic
		yeah crawling under enclosed spaces would be sick
		noting this here so i dont forget it
		would like crawling to open up into rooms with extra minerals or something like that, or maybe they are just a common part of cave gen
	animations/artwork
		dwarf character
			take inspiration from my minecraft character i think
			lantern on hip
			helmet
			bracers on arms
			shoulder pad
			beard obviously
			ale flask
			pouches / bandolier
	enemy mechanics
		spawn waves? like in DRG 
			so sometimes the focus is on getting the minerals, and other times there are too many enemies to worry about minerals
			increased intensity over time of the waves, which pressures the player to leave the cave or risk dying next time since it might be too much
		rock faces
			i want rock shapes that can either be seen as normal rocks or like super creepy distorted faces
			i guess im looking at "images/creepy little guy.png" and i have some thoughts on it
			i think it would be unsettling if on the edge of your vision you saw this mfer and then it turns to a rock and doesnt move
			wait should the enemies be like golem creatures? am i cooking rn??? like rock thingies
			maybe if they are rock enemies the reason they are tryna kill you is cuz your digging up the minerals this actually makes so much sense actually
			and sometimes if you double back to look at the rock ITS GONE THAT WOULD BE SO CREEPY LOL
		lantern flickering to indicate a wave is coming
			idk i just think this would make sense since being in complete darkness = creepy and having your light taken away for a second would put you on edge if it was your only light source
			i think all of the light sources would need to have this happen, like if i added flares and such
			could expand on this by having light sources that arent the lantern stay permanently dim after, or like having the flickering occur at different speeds between light sources etc
		could take inspiration from luigis mansion ghosts? they were creepy
			and five nights at freddies like the eyes freaked me out
			inspiration from the bracken from lethal company
				i think it would be sick if these rock faces followed behind you, so when you go to double back youll see one that wasnt there 2 seconds ago, like it was just outside of your light the whole time
	make backpack bigger? to make silhouette more fleshed out
	loading screen
		our boy throws a torch into a hole, and it falls and slowly the light fades away
		while the torch is rotating, and after it stops illuminating the wall, it becomes an element of a loading wheel type deal
		this might take too long and could be annoying actually but i thought of it because i think it could set the mood going from a cheery tavern area to a dim, dark, eerie cave system
	mantle mechanic
		i want the dwarf to be able to grab ledges and pull himself up
		should also work for small ledges, like the platforms that go up a half tile
	"coyote time"
		the thing where you have a bit of space for if you arent perfect in timing jumps
	marking mechanic
		need an item for players to place down that says 'i have been here!'
		can be a sign, one of those rock piles you see on hiking trails, something like that
		they are called CAIRNS
	climbable rock pattern for vertical sections of hallway
		like the rocks in caves in rust
		like vines in legend of zelda games
		part of wall itself, not section in between walls
		water drips from ceiling above 
			1) creates water at bottom if player needs to jump down and get the fuck away from something
			2) explains chipped sides
			3) atmosphere with drippy sounds
	upgrade system  tied to tavern decorations, not stickers 
	if you die, you respawn at a cairn
		however this also removes all cairns and you have a limited inventory, no gems or anything
		like a second chance mechanic
		rewards careful play, by keeping the cairns in if you dont die
		punished un careful play, by making it harder to return home
	enemy type that is weaker and has gems in it, makes killing them rewarding bc you get stuff and its more fun that way too
	level generation
		a level / biome could consist of unlimited 'sublevels', which each take from a predefined graph structure layout for that specific biome. When the player is going through each sublevel, there is one 'exit' for leaving the level and returning to the tavern, and one (or multiple) doors which each on their own generate another 'sublevel' when the player goes through them, and links back to the door they just came through. This way, level generation would not take that long, and I wouldn't be constricted to having to create extremely large graph structures to define the layout of a biome. I could modulate it.
	

reasons i want to make this game
	i love the tavern aesthetic
	i want there to be more creepy horror type games, and that can be explored in the cave side of this game
	i like the idea of the producers that use your minerals for drugs
	i like the idea of having to go down and mine to get the materials for the game to progress since i like mining
	i like dwarves so the player should be one
	i want my own game to implement my idea of the sticker system, and the 'blam!' / 'dink' text effects when the player does stuff
	i wish more games did the 'blam!' text stuff and so i want to have it in mine
	it would make sense to be 2d and making a 3d game would be way too daunting for me 
	the art is something i could maybe make with pixel art and this is an aesthetic i wouldnt get tired of trying to make compared to other things
		


ideas i like so far
	lantern, which lights up the cave, adds to creepy atmosphere, and is what the stickers go on
		need particle/lighting effects for this
	light v heavy dive types
		npcs either defending on heavy dives, or adding bonuses for you on light dives
	ale gun trump card / last resort / powerful bonus if you have reserve ale
	drug empire using minerals you get from the cave, the people you purchase the ingrediants from are your customers
	having "Blam!" effects when you shoot is a must for me 
		like from Roboquest (the game korbin played that one time)
	drop zones system in mid game - late game
	npcs can follow you on light dives because to get in there, you have to be small which you are since you are a dwarf 
	'producers' as a name for the people you sell minerals to
	'producers' reason for setting up rival business / trying to kill you later / allying with each other is so they can steal your mineral mine for themselves, including the ultimate crystal at the end
	flamethrower stuff above ^
	axe and pickaxe and the way they get introduced
	flashlight for gun, lantern on character which is always on
	crawling animation / mechanic along with the other animations im working on
	
	
things i gotta have 
	lantern + stickers + lighting/particles for it
	ale gun
	"blam" or "dink" effects 
	power smashes on mineral nodes (that give you less material but is faster and way more awesome)
	'producers' story, including the rival business, how they have a drug empire based off your minerals, and how they try to kill you at the end
	axe and pickaxe tools
	moss caves biome
