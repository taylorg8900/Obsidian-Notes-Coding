Webflow has different features, listed as the below:

## Webflow's Features
- **The Designer**
	- This is basically a drag and drop way of implementing HTML elements onto a page, so you can visually design what you wnt it to look like.
	- Towards the bottom of [this page](https://webflow.com/design), there is a line that reads "Download a ZIP of all your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other assets on our paid plans.". This might be useful for figuring out version control, if I can't find resources for that online.
- **The CMS** (Content Management System)
	- You use the CMS to create a **Collection**, which is a custom content type (such as a product page). You use the Designer to determine how a Collection item looks.
- **Ecommerce**
	- Webflow allows you to connect payment gateways through this
- **Hosting**
	- The servers that Webflow uses to host their websites, which uses Amazon Web Services. Since this makes Webflow a third party tool, they have security features built in that you can use.
