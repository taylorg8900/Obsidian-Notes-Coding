# Large Scale

Level Select
- As you progress, the new areas that you unlock could be different mountain ranges, and the way to beat that area would be by finding the `heart of the mountain`. I am thinking of a level select similar to BroForce.
- You have to go further and further down the mountain until you reach the `heart of the mountain`. This could be done with a traditional level select, or could be one very large sprawling level that is generated which the player can leave and enter at any time, until they find the heart.
